I've been in love with 'em all
Every man in this dir'y ol' city
There's many a bloke I recall
Who's added some love to my kitty
Keep your virtues
I don't have time
Keep your lovers
I'm changin' mine
Ive got so much lovin' that I'm
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Ladies don't face me and sneer
And think of your husbands affection
With the husband you're holdin' so near
I've probably had a connection 
Keep your morals
I don't have time
Keep your lovers
I'm changin' mine
I've hung every fruit on my vine
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Don't knock us poor lovers of love
Our service is breif but so tender
We get your poor fellas because
You forget the tricks we remember (oh yeah!)
Keep your epics 
I don't have time
Keep your lovers
I'm changin' mine
Come all husbands
Get in a line
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Keep your efforts
I don't have time
Keep your lovers
I'm changin' mine
I've got so much lovin' that I'm
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Your views of me are quite beyond the pale
You assume I lead a life of total rest
When my day to day existence is a tale
Of neverending drive and zest
I hardly have a second I can truly call my own
It seems that every thirty minutes another hour has flown
The older you become the more you recognize the fact
One has little time to meditate and even less to act
If you stagnate and semi-slumber 
You shall never make your mark
No slacker has succeeded 
Since the days of Noah's ark
I can't exceed my alotted span 
No matter how I try
But I've quite enough to do 
Until I die
So you see how important 
And imperative 
Significant and vital
Is each second that we live
We must understand the gravity
Our lives will be futility 
If we take 
More than we can give
Them's just words 
And we don't know 
If they're true
When you ain't talkin 
Jus' what else 
Can you do?
I have books to read on medicine 
Theology and law
There's a world I want to see 
I want to know what life is for
I have hopes I have ambitions 
I'll achieve them if I can
There's so much I want to do 
I'm a very busy man
I'm a very busy man
And so when every day begins
I makes me out a list 
Of me most essential sins
From the catalog advice
I choose me favorite for the fall
It's enough for the day 
I never feel like any more
I am frankly unimpressed by your attitude 
I am not convinced that you are on the ball
You could do worse than show a glimmering of gratitude
For the fact that you're alive at all
I am a very busy man 
I have no time to throw away
I need twenty seven hours or more
In every working day
My hour to hour arrangements
Are a copmlicated squeeze
I do many things I have to do 
In twos or even threes
I hardly have the time 
To justify myself to you
There are many more important things 
That I could find to do
Time never waits 
And it's never on my side
My every waking moment
Must be fully occupied
I aint got no gifts to bring
this aint paris it aint spring
No pearls for you to wear
I would'nt mind a bit of that
I don't have no shinning moon
we're bloody miles from june
but you know love is here.
All them poets with their rhyme
their pretty words in time
are missing whats so clear
It dos'nt mean a thing to me
Painters they have missed it to
writters havent got a clue
they cant see love is here
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
things i feel so plainly
and what matters mainly is
i got you here today
You wont get sweet words from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
kings and queens are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
things i feel so plainly
and what matters mainly is
i got you here today
You wont get sweet words from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
kings and queens are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
things i feel so plainly
and what matters mainly is
i got you here today
You wont get sweet words from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
kings and queens are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
But you know love is here
Yes you know love is here
Yes you know love is here
It's easy to be careless let a lifetime hurry by
Live aimlessly forever and be nothing til you die
I would have let that happen, but suddenly I found
My little world invaded by a strange and lovely sound
Softly through the rush and roar of day
When the still of night draws near
From the depths of somewhere far away
A strange and lovely song I hear
Tumblin' shapes and clouds of melody
Spin my troubles through the air
Steal the key and find the harmony
Of a strange and lovely song so rare
Before all my dreams were a pattern
Fading colors of grey and brown and blue
But these patterns are changing to pictures
And I feel like I am changing too
Though I wander through a haunting haze
Touched by sounds I cannot see
I shall someday understand who plays
Such a strange and lovely song to me
But these patterns are changing to pictures
And I feel like I am changing too
Though I wander through a haunting haze
Touched by sounds I cannot see
I shall oneday understand who plays
Such a strange and lovely song to me
Who is this Barnardo chap who thinks he owns the town?
Someone's gotta show this mush that he needs some takin' down
We'll get him if it kills us all. That bloke is heading for a fall, 
He's gotta go, we'll do him in, we'll get him in the end.
Who the hell does he think he is in everybody's way?
Someone's gotta sort him out, Barnardo's gotta pay.
We'll get him if its all we do. That bloke will very soon be through.
He's gotta go we'll do him in, we'll get him in the end.
Barbardo is a social pest his meddling days are gone.
We'll run the blighter outta town. Its time he's sat upon.
We'll get him if it means a war, he'll soon see what we're standing for.
He's gotta go we'll do him in we'll get him in the end.
We'll get, him, in, the, end.
