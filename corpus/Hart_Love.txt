            Madame Giry: Phantasma, City of Wonders. Mr. Y presents marvels, astonishments human prodigies. Puh, the Oh La La girl, five
performances a day. Christine Da’ae, the soprano of the century, gone, all gone

Fleck: Yes, there’s nothing left nothing but ghosts, but I knew you’d come back, Madame Giry

Madame Giry: You! you, still here?

Fleck: Of course were still here! The freaks, the monstrous, the bizarre, where else could we exist but here? And, after the
tragedy, after the master disappeared with the child,after the fire that consumed everything!

Madame Giry: His dream, our dream!

Fleck: Remember how it was? Remember. (Singing) Coney Isle, glistening and glimmering rising bright, drenched with light see
it smile beckoning and shimmering all a gleam, like a dream every fantasy set free, sudden rising by the sea,

Madame Giry: (Singing) Coney Isle, miracle on miracle, light and sound, all around, mile by mile loud and loud and lyrical.
Thrill, on thrill, never still. All america was there. Begger next to billionaire. In they came chasing sensation and
romance. Eyes aflame, desperate for pleasures yet unknown. Night and day, coming in by the hundred of thousands. Swept away
by their every desire made real! (Scream is heard)

Madame Giry: (Speaking) What do you mean?

Fleck: That’s the world you destroyed with your greed!

Madame Giry: (Speaking) It wasn't my fault! I couldn't have known!

Fleck: Don't you remember what happened back then? When we even we dared to walk among men!
When even a phantom could dream his dark dreams once again...

            Til I Hear You Sing       
            The day starts, the day ends
Time crawls by
Night steals in, pacing the floor
The moments creep,
Yet I can?t bear to sleep
Till I hear you sing

And weeks pass, and months pass
Seasons fly
Still you don?t walk through the door
And in a haze
I count the silent days
Till I hear you sing once more.

And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing but the empty air

And years come, and years go
Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul
Can?t be alive and whole
Till I hear you sing once more

And music, your music
It teases at my ear
I turn and it fades away and you?re not here

Let hopes pass, let dreams pass
Let them die
Without you, what are they for?
I?ll always feel
No more than halfway real
Till I hear you sing once more

            Giry Confronts The Phantom / Are you Ready to Begin       
            Meg: Tell me, did you watch? Tell me that you saw
Did you hear the crowd, the way they cheered, I hope you're proud
Did you like the new routine? Was it passable, I mean
I can change a thing or two, what should I do?
No, don't say it, I can guess, but I promise I'll progress

The Phantom: Yes, of course. Whatever you feel is best

Meg: Did the costume look okay? Too revealing, would you say?
People seemed to like the view

Madame Giry: Meg, please...

Meg: I could show a bit more skin, that would sure bring 'em in --

Madame Giry: Meg! Can't you see that the master's at work?
Can't you see that his mind's somewhere else?
Can't you see that obviously he's thinking of things more important than you?

The Phantom: Careful, Madame. You're forgetting yourself.

Madame Giry: Don't you see he forgot what this is?
Opening day, a big deal, what a fuss
Our success means not I guess compared to the things that the Master must do!

The Phantom: That's quite enough!

Madame Giry: Christine! Christine.

Meg: Christine...

Madame Giry: Meg, leave. Now!
In Paris, when the mob surrounded you, who was there? We were there.
Where was she when the low men hounded you? Gone, long gone. We stayed on.
Who concealed you safe away? Smuggled you up to Calet? Found a freighter out of France?

The Phantom: I don't see the problem. This is ancient history.

Madame Giry: And once here, when the side show hired you, who stood by? Meg and I
While they kept you on display, who kept working night and day?
Who gave you their very lives?
And who helped you buy that side show?
Who helped you finance you scheme? Who wouldn't quit 'till your act was a hit?
And your hit could become your dream?
Who played the politicians, lured investors and the press? No, not her
And who stayed with you, helped you and advised you?
We stayed with you, loved and idolized you
She betrayed you, shunned you and despised you!
She chose Raoul, chose his beauty and youth.
It's long past time you faced --

The Phantom: Enough! You'll be repaid as I promised you would. Now, if you've anything else left to say...

Oh Christine, my Christine, yes you've fled from my face once before
But Christine, what we shared, even you can't ignore!
My Christine, I'll be no longer denied; I'll have you back by my side, my sweet Christine!
And come what may, I swear, somehow, some way, I will hear you sing once more!

It's a funhouse where the mirrors all reflect what's real.

And reality's as twisted as the mirrors reveal
And the fun is finding out what the mirrors show

            Look With Your Heart       
            [Christine]
Love's a curious thing, it often comes disguised
Look at love the wrong way, it goes unrecognized

So look with your heart, and not with your eyes
The heart understands, the heart never lies
Believe what it feels, and trust what it shows
Look with your heart, the heart always knows
Love is not always beautiful, not at the start

So open your arms, and close your eyes tight
Look with your heart, and when it finds love, your heart will be right

Learn from someone who knows, make sure you don't forget
Love you misunderstand is love that you'll regret

[Gustave]
Mother?
Look with your heart, and not with your eyes
The heart can't be fooled

[Christine]
The heart is too wise

[Gustave]
Forget what you think

[Christine]
Ignore what you hear

[Christine and Gustave]
Look with your heart, it always sees clear

Love is not always beautiful, not at the start

            [Christine]
I should have know that you'd be here, I should have known it all along
This whole arrangement bears your stamp; you're in each measure of that song
How dare you try and claim me now? How dare you come invade my life?

[Phantom]
Oh Christine, my Christine, in that time when the world thought me dead
My Christine, on that night just before you wed, ah Christine
You came and found where I hid, don't you deny that you did, that long ago night

[Christine]
That night...

[Phantom]
Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky
Too dark to see a thing, too dark to even try

[Christine]
I strode to your side, to tell you I must go
I couldn't see your face, but sensed you even so
And I touched you

[Phantom]
And I felt you

[Phantom and Christine]
And I heard those ravishing refrains

[Christine]
The music of your pulse

[Phantom]
The singing in your veins

[Christine]
And I held you

[The Phantom]
And I touched you

[Christine]
And embraced you

[Phantom]
And I felt you

[The Phantom and Christine]
And with every breath and every sigh

[Christine]
I felt no longer scared

[Phantom]
I felt no longer shy

[Phantom and Christine]
At last our feelings bared
Beneath a moonless sky

[Christine]
And blind in the dark, as soul gazed into soul;
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole

[Phantom]
Cloaked under the night, with nothing to suppress
A woman and a man, no more and yet no less
And I kissed you

[Christine]
And caressed you

The Phantom and Christine: And the world around us fell away
We said things in the dark, we never dare to say

[The Phantom]
And I caught you

[Christine]
And I kissed you

[Phantom]
And I took you

[Christine]
And caressed you

[Phantom and Christine]
With a need too urgent to deny
As nothing mattered then, except for you and I
Again and then again, beneath a moonless sky

[Phantom]
And when it was done, before the sun could rise
Ashamed of what I was, afraid to see your eyes
I stood while you slept and whispered a good-bye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky

[Christine]
And I loved you, yes, I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you led
I woke to swear my love, and found you gone instead

[The Phantom]
And I loved you

[Christine]
I loved you

[Phantom]
And I left you

[Christine]
How I loved you

[Phantom]
And I had to, both of us knew why

[Christine]
We both knew why

[Phantom and Christine]
And yet I won't regret from now until I die
A night I can't forget beneath a moonless sky

[Phantom]
And now...

[Christine]
How can you talk of now? For us... there is no now.

Once upon that other time, we did what we thought must be done

Once upon another time, I knew how our story would end
And maybe I was wrong, but now the moment's gone
Were it still that other time, I'd make time itself somehow bend
But now I'm not that strong, and time keeps moving on

Madame Giry: How could I know? Why would they come?
Meg: Why won't they go?
All: My dear old friend. Can't believe you're here, old friend
Madame Giry: Speaking as your host
Meg: As an artist
Christine: What a surprise
Raoul: To say the least
All: Yes, dear old friend. That's a happy tear, old friend. I can't conceal, try though I may, the way I feel, so I pretend, I'm
sure it's clear, to such a dear old friend
Madame Giry: You mustn't stay!
Christine: Why would I leave?
Raoul: Why are we here?
Meg: Don't play naive
All: What dear old friends. Don't we all live here, old friends?
Raoul: Nothing has been changed
Meg: And never will
Madame Giry and Christine: Just rearranged
All: And yet we're still, such grand old friends, such devoted and old friends. Words cannot suggest what's in my heart and for the
rest why even start?
All:My dear old friends! So much longer near, old friends. Back again at last. When everyone Is doing great. Won't this be fun?
With dear old friends. Utterly sincere old friends!
Meg: Honey, break a leg
Raoul: Madame, good day
Madame Giry: Enjoy your stay
Christine: Hope it extends
All: So glad you're here! A lovely dear old friend! Old friend!

Things You Know You Can't Confess?
Things You Thirst For Nonetheless?

            The Phantom Confronts Christine       
            Christine: Gustave! It's alright, it's me! Gustave. Please, take him away.
I'm so sorry, please forgive him. He meant no harm.

The Phantom: How could you think I wouldn't guess?

Christine: What do you mean?

The Phantom: How could you think I wouldn't know?

Christine: Oh no...

The Phantom: Do you have something to confess?

Christine: Please don't make me!

The Phantom: I want the truth right now if so!

Christine: Once upon another time, you went off and left me alone
But that's not all you did. You left me with a son.
Ever since that other time, I wish how I wish you'd have known
I kept the secret hid, the secret my marriage forbid
What else could I have done?
Just love

The Phantom: A son...

Christine: Just live

The Phantom: My son...

Christine: Just give what I can give, and take what little I deserve

The Phantom: My own flesh and blood and even he recoils in horror from me. Just like his mother.

Christine: Forgive me, I beg you, if you can
I've brought you nothing but woe
Tomorrow night, I'll sing with all my heart
Sing for you again!
Then we'll go.

The Phantom: From out of ugliness, such light
From out of darkness, such a flame
In him my wrongness is made right
And yet he loathes me all the same

So let him shun me in disgust
Let him flee this cursed face
If I must hide from him I must
Yet shall he be my saving grace

For Christine, my Christine
If it's true I've no reason to live
Then Christine, then a boy shall have all I can give
Ah Christine
All I create on this earth
All that I'll never be worth
All shall be his!

Madame Giry: Ten long years and he casts us aside
Ten whole years, this is how we're repaid
Ten dark years of toil and tears
And now what we've worked for will go to that child!

All our hopes were at last in our grasp
All the dreams and the plans that we laid
Everything is vanishing
And we get discarded, rejected, reviled

All of the bonds in between is now torn
All of the love that we gave him forsworn
All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!

            Why Does She Love Me       
            Raoul (spoken):
One more.

Barman (spoken):
Ah Buddy, don't you think you've had enough? It's practically morning already.

Raoul (spoken):
One more I said!

Barman (spoken):
Alright, alright.
My shift is over anyway, so let's settle the bill okay?. Jeez you're in a bad way ain't you? The worst of the most end up
here. Here's the morning shift. Maybe he'll know what to do with you.

Raoul (spoken):
Yes what to do with me.
That's the question isn't it? That's always been the question. Ever since the beginning.

Raoul(sung):
She looks for sympathy
I give her sorrow
She asks for honesty
I've none to borrow
She needs my tender kiss
She begs it of me
I give her ugliness
Why does she love me?

She yearns for higher things
Things I can't give her
The rush the music brings
I can't deliver
And even when she sings
And soars above me
I try to clip her wings
Why does she love me?

One more drink sir
That's what I need don't you think sir?
Leave the hurt behind.

(spoken) Didn't you hear me?
Another drink!

(sung) She wants the man I was
Husband and father
At least she thinks she does
She needn't bother.

Beneath this mask I wear
There's nothing of me
Just horror, shame, dispair
Why does she love me?

How about you sir?
Tell me what am I to do sir
Leave the hurt behind.

Meg:
Morning Bernie
Coffee please
Hurry up before I freeze
I'll just take it black

(spoken)
Meg:
Mother said I'd find you here.

Raoul:
Miss Giry.

Meg:
Do you know where you are?

Raoul:
Hell, I imagine.

Meg:
Around here, they call it Suicide Hall. Its where people end up when they don't know where else to go. The hopeless, the
desperate. It's a good place to step off the side of a pier and quietly vanish.

Raoul:
You seem to be a regular?

Meg:
Me? I come here to swim.

(sung) This town is coarse and cold and mean
It's hard to keep your conscience clean.
Faceless in the crowd
Anythings allowed.
And so I come at dawn each day
Come to wash it all away
Sink into the sea
Blue and cool and kind
Let it set me free
Let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind

(spoken)
Meg:
You should never of come to America.
It's not a place for people like you and Christine. It's too easy to forget who you are and where you belong. That's why
mother says you must leave here. Now. Take your wife and the boy and go.

Raoul:
Leave? But what about tonight? The concert, the money. Am I to just run away? From him?

Meg:
When the sun rises tomorrow we can all start again. Clean.

(sung) Sail across the sea
Put us out of mind
Close your eyes and flee
Let yourself stay blind
Leave this place behind

            Devil Take The Hindmost       
            Raoul:
Miss Giry! I'm not afraid of him! I've bested him before! And if he ever had the courage to meet me face to face, man to
man! No...no, it can't be!

Phantom:
Not afraid of me, you say?

Raoul:
Stay back, or I'll kill you I promise you!

Phantom:
Of course, as you say you've beaten me before. But that was a long time ago, Vicomte, and we were playing a different game.
Look at you,
Deep in debt, stinking drunk, pitiful
Shall we two make a bet
Devil take the hindmost

Raoul:
Look at you,
Foul as sin, hideous, horrible
Call the stakes, deal me in
Devil take the hindmost

Phantom:
Our Christine shall choose tonight

Raoul: Let her choose

Phantom:
Is she yours or mine?

Raoul:
Draw the line

Phantom:
If she sings, you lose tonight

Raoul:
I won't lose

Phantom:
You leave from here

Raoul:
Fine!

Phantom:
Disappear

Raoul:
Fine!
And if she won't, if I win?

Phantom:
All your debts, wiped away

Raoul:
Very well, let's begin

The Phantom and Raoul: Devil take the hindmost

Raoul: You think you have the odds
You think you're in control
You think you've fixed the dice
Well I will gladly roll
I'll bet against the house
I'll even double down

Phantom:
Our whole game, it's been changed
Every throw, riskier
All the rules, rearranged
Fate has re-designed most

Raoul:
Fortune's on my side
I won her long ago!
I won her from you then
I'll wager even now
I'll win her back again
And when the game is done

Phantom:
Cut the deck, let us play
Roll the die, once again
In the end
Either way!

Phantom and Raoul:
Devil take the hindmost!
Now Christine shall choose at last
Is she yours or mine?

Raoul:
We've a son, a bond secure

Phantom:
Are you sure?

Raoul: What?

Phantom:
Are you so sure?

Raoul:
What do you mean?

Phantom:
Such a child, strange to see
Different, musical

Raoul: Huh?

Phantom:
Is he more you or me?
Which one do you find most?

Raoul:
You lie!
I call your bluff, the game is on
And we will see, who wins out
Once and for all

Phantom:
Deal the cards, let them fall
Choose your hand, try your best
He who wins

Phantom and Raoul:
Wins it all!
Devil take the hindmost

Raoul:
I call your bluff, the game is on
And we will see, who wins out
Once and for all

Phantom:
Deal the cards, let them fall
Choose your hand, try your best
He who wins

Phantom and Raoul:
Wins it all!
Devil take the hindmost!

Phantom:
She walks, you leave together.
Pockets full, debts paid.
She sings, you leave alone.

Phantom:
Devil take the hindmost.
Raoul:
My god, what have I done? Look at me, the concert's only hours away...

            Heaven By The Sea (Reprise)       
            All: It's the last day of the season
And there ain't a single cloud
What a day to leave the city on a spree
Away from all the hustle and the bustle and the crowd
On a little slice of heaven by the sea

It's the last day of the season to indulge
(Forget the factory and the scrum)
To be rested and relaxed and fancy free
(One day more then back to work)
To flee from all the bother and the hassle and the noise

Man: With your lady

Woman: And your fella

Couple: And your kids and your umbrella

All: On a little slice of heaven by the sea
The surf, the sand, the breeze, the food,
The peace and calm, the restful mood,
Amid the sea and spray
The city falls away
The sun (the sun), the sea (the sea), the salty air,
The miles (the miles) of beach (of beach) with room to spare,

Man: And the pretzels

Woman: And the custard

Man 1: And the girls!
Man 2: The francs!
Man 3: The mustard!
Woman 1: And the tanning!
Woman 2: And the lotion!
Woman 3: And the pier,
Man 1: The beer,
Man 2: The ocean,

Woman: And the oysters,

Man: And the pickles,

Man 2: And the knockers,

Man 3: And the steamers,

All: It's a little slice of heaven by the sea

What a treat to get away
From the frantic and the fray
All the cluster and the fuss

To this placid little beach
Far beyond the city's reach
And it's only for us

What a joy to convalesce
From the city's wild excess
And forget it all like thus

On this sheltered little slice
Of a seaside paradise...

It's the last day of the season
So relax and have a beer
Hurry up, the summer's almost over...

Mother did you watch
Everything is sold
Mother can't you tell
The new routine, it went so well

I was worried just a touch
That it might have been too much
Just a bit, well, rather free

But just listen to the crowd
Why they've never been so loud
Screaming only for me.

Indeed she does. As lovely as she looked the very first time I came to her dressing room door.

And look at you Raoul! You look just like that handsome boy in the opera box. The one who would always toss me a single red
rose.

There's one thing more I'd have you do
If you love me as I love you

Anything darling

Don't sing the song dear

Let me just get through this. Listen, please. I need to.

Raoul:
You need so much it's true
And I've denied you
You need the man you knew,
Back here beside you
You'll have him back I vow
Just ask it of me.
But we must leave here now
If you still love me.

Christine (spoken):
Do you mean it Raoul? Truly?

Raoul (spoken):
I've booked a passage for three on the Atlantic Queen. It leaves in an hour, we'll have just enough time. I beg you. Lets be
on it. For both our sakes and the child's.

Leave this place behind.

Phantom:
He knows his love is not enough
He knows he isn't what you need
He knows you're made of finer stuff
I think on that, we're all agreed.

It's time to leave him in the dust
It's time to be who you should be
It's time to do now as you must
And set the music in you free.

In moments, mere moments,
Drums will roll.
There'll you stand
Just like before.

The crowd will hush
And then in one sweet rush
I will hear you sing once more.
And music, our music
Will swell and then unwind
Like two strands of melody
At last entwined.

Fulfill us, complete us
Make us full
Seal our bond forever more
Tonight, for me,
Embrace your destiny.
Let me hear you sing
Once more.

Twisted in every way
What answer can I give?

I know I can't refuse
And yet I wish I could
Oh god

Christine, Christine
Don't think that I dont care
But every hope and every prayer
Rests on you now.

            Devil Take The Hindmost (Quartet)       
            Raoul:
Will she sing?
Will she flee?
What is she
thinking now?

Is it him?
Is it me?
Devil take the hindmost.

Stagehand 1: (spoken) Ready on the floor?
Stagehand 2: (spoken) Ready on the floor!

(Overlapping)
Raoul:
Will she stay?
Will she go?
Does she know
Even know?
Please Christine
Stop the show

Phantom:
Obey your heart
And sing for me
You want it so
Stay and be mine
Eternally

Both:
Devil take the hindmost.

Now it's time
To make your choice
Do it for our son

Phantom: Use your head

Raoul: No time to wait

Both:
Hesitate
We're all undone

Stagehand 1: (spoken) Ready in the pit?
Stagehand 2: (spoken) Ready in the pit!

(Overlapping)

Madame Giry:
Perhaps she won't go on
Perhaps she'll lose her nerve
Perhaps her voice won't serve
And she will fail him now
And then my child and I
Will get what we deserve

Raoul:
Will she stay?
Will she go?
Does she know
Even know?
Please Christine
Stop the show

Phantom:
Obey your heart
And sing for me
And sing for me
Give me the child
Eternally

All:
Devil take the hindmost.

(Repeat)

All:
Now it's time
No turning back
All is on the line.

Here it is
The final dance
One last chance to get what's mine.

Madame Giry:(spoken)
I hope Christine is worthy of you. I hope her singing makes up for what your blindness has done to Meg and me.

Meg: Devil take the hindmost.

            Love Never Dies       
            Christine:
Who knows when love begins, who knows what makes it start
One day it's simply there, a life inside your heart
It slips into your thoughts, it infiltrates your soul
It takes you by surprise, then seizes full control
Try to deny it and try to protest
But love won't let you go, once you've been possessed

Love never dies, love never falters
Once it has spoken, love is yours
Love never fails, love never alters
Hearts may get broken, love endures
Hearts may get broken, love endures

And soon as you submit, surrender flesh and bone
That love takes on a life much bigger than your own
It uses you at whim, and drives you to despair
And forces you to feel more joy than you can bear
Love gives you pleasure and love brings you pain
And yet, when both are gone, love will still remain

Once it has spoken, love is yours
Love never dies, love never alters
Hearts may get broken, love endures
Hearts may get broken...

Love never dies, love will continue
Love keeps on beating, when you're gone
Love never dies, once it is in you
Life may be fleeting, love lives on
Life may be fleeting
Love lives on

            Ah, Christine!       
            Phantom:
Ah, Christine, my Christine,
What a triumph you gave me tonight
My Christine, all the dark silent years now set right, ah Christine

Christine:
The song was beautiful, it sounded beautiful
Every note, every word
And it felt beautiful, and I felt beautiful

The Phantom and Christine:
Lost in the music once more
Feeling it rise up and soar
Alive once again!

Christine: My dearest wife...

Raoul: Little Lotte, I beg you, forgive me

Christine: Raoul, no!

Raoul: Little Lotte, ah, what fools we once were

Christine and Raoul: Long ago in our youth

Christine:
In Paris, at the opera

Raoul:
Romantic idiot...

Christine:
Those two people are gone

Raoul and Christine:
Now I must go, our choices are made
The opera is done; the last notes have been played

Raoul:
May your angel of music watch over you now
And give you what I wish I gave you somehow
Yours, in regret

Christine:
Raoul.

            Gustave! Gustave!       
            Christine: Gustave...

The Phantom: What is it?

Christine: Gustave

The Phantom: What's wrong?

Christine: Gustave!

The Phantom: What's wrong?!

Christine: He should be here, he was meant to be here!

The Phantom: It's that idiot Raoul,
Why I'll kill that drunken fool!
That he dare take this child
A child that isn't his
Mr. Squelch!

Squelch: Sir?

The Phantom: Seal the port, blockade each road
Call in every favour that I'm owed
I'll be damned if he leaves this isle!

Squelch: The Vicomte de Chagney left here in a carriage
Saw with my own eyes, sir
There was no one with him

The Phantom: Are you quite certain he left here alone?

Squelch: Sir, was there anyone else here backstage?

The Phantom: Yes. Yes...
Madame Giry, she was here, with her vicious little sneer
And that comment she made
The ungrateful back-biting snake!
She's been greedy, yes indeed,
She'll get hers now guaranteed!
Go now, quickly, bring her round
Bring the boy safe and sound
Then I'll tear her limb from limb!

Madame Giry: What is the meaning of this? How dare your minions manhandle me in this fashion? I demand an answer.

The Phantom: The boy woman! What have you done with him?

Madame Giry: The boy, you think I took the boy? Why would I do such a thing? Do you think I don't know who he is?
All these years,
Who has been more faithful more than I? No one!

The Phantom: Giry!

Madame Giry: All these years,
How can you think I'd hurt that child?

The Phantom: My patience is running dry!

Madame Giry: All these years,
I've been mother to you and Christine as much as my daughter

The Phantom: Enough!

Madame Giry: Do you think I don't know it hurts to see one's own child brought to harm?

The Phantom: Gustave! Gustave! Gustave!

Fleck: Sir
I just passed Meg's dressing room
It was empty as a tomb
But her mirror was smashed all in pieces on the floor

The Phantom: Meg!

Madame Giry: My god...

Fleck: And I saw her down the hall
Pulling someone pale and small
And she looked all about
And the scurried out the door

Madame Giry: God, I left her so distraught
Please, who knows just what she thought
I'm afraid she's come undone
But she won't hurt him
Meg would never hurt him
How could she hurt him?

The Phantom: I know where they've gone. But we must hurry!

Madame Giry: In that crowd? There are millions of people out there!

Christine: Gustave...my poor Gustave...

The Phantom: There's no time to waste!

Christine: Gustave!
Gustave! Gustave!

The Phantom: You there! Stop!

Christine: That's not him!

Madame Giry: Meg!

The Phantom: I think I see them; this way!

Christine: Gustave is that -- I'm so sorry!

Madame Giry: Meg, please! It's okay!

The Phantom: To the pier, now! Hurry!

            Please, Miss Giry, I want to go back...       
            Please, Miss Giry
I want to go back
I want my mother

The world is hard
The world is mean
It's hard to keep
Your conscience clean

Please, you're hurting me

The sea is calm
The sea is gray
It washes
Everything away

I can't swim
Don't worry, it's almost over

Sink into the deep
Blue and cool and kind
Then drift off to sleep
Let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind

Gustave
Mother
No, I'm not done yet

Let go of the boy now
Not another step
Let go of him, girl, or I promise you
Not another word

Always wondered
How to make you watch
Well, watch me now

I took a little trip to Coney Island
I took a little trip because of you
I did as Mother said and followed where you led
And tried to do what little I could do

Well, here's the way it works on Coney Island
They make you pay for every little crumb
I gave what they would take, I gave it for your sake
Now look at me and see what I've become

Bathing beauty on the beach
Bathing beauty in her dressing room
Bathing beauty in the dark
On their laps, in their arms, in their beds

Meg, my little Meg
What are you saying?

Who helped you raise the money?
Who helped the permits come through?
Who greased the wheels of your high flying deals
Bought you time when the bills came due?

Who swayed the local bosses
Curried favor with the press?
No, not her
And who kept singing, desperate for your favor
Who kept dancing, hoping you would save her
Who kept dying and this is what you gave her

Now that I've got your attention at last
Here's the big finish and then you can go

Give me the gun, Meg
Give me the hurt and the pain and the gun, Meg
Give me the blame for not seeing the things
That you've done, Meg

Give me the gun, Meg
Give me the chance to see you clear at last
See me clear at last
You feel ugly, you feel used
You feel broken, you feel bruised

Ah, but me, I can see all the beauty underneath
Yes
You've been robbed of love and pride
Been ignored and pushed aside
Even so, I still know there is beauty underneath
Yes

Diamonds never sparkle right
If they aren't set just right
Beauty sometimes goes unseen
We can't all be like Christine

Christine, Christine
Always Christine

No, I didn't mean to
Mother, there, say something
Say anything
Giry, go get help, now

Where's Papa?
He should be here
Where's Papa?
Your father, your real father

Look with your heart and not with your eyes
The heart understands, the heart never lies
Believe what it feels and trust what it shows
Look with your heart, the heart always knows

Love is not always beautiful
Not at the start
So open your arms
And close your eyes tight
Look with your heart
And when you find love

No

Once upon another time, our story had only begun
I had a taste of joy, the most I ever knew
Now there isn't any time and somehow our story is done
And what about the boy, what am I to do?

Just love, just live
And give what we can give
And take the love that you deserve
Just love, just live
And give all that I have
And take what little I deserve

Come closer, I beg you
Closer still
Remember love never dies
Kiss me one last time
