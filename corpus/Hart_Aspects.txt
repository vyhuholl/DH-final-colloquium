Love,
Love changes everything:
Hands and faces,
Earth and sky,
Love,
Love changes everything:
How you live and
How you die
Love
Can make the summer fly,
Or a night
Seem like a lifetime.
Yes, Love,
Love changes everything:
Now I tremble
At your name.
Nothing in the
World will ever
Be the same.
Love,
Love changes everything:
Days are longer,
Words mean more.
Love,
Love changes everything:
Pain is deeper
Than before.
Love
Will turn your world around,
And that world
Will last for ever.
Yes, Love,
Love changes everything,
Brings you glory,
Brings you shame.
Nothing in the
World will ever
Why did I go back to see her...?
Alex, it's all in the past...
Off
Into the world we go,
Planning futures,
Shaping years.
Love,
Bursts in, and suddenly
All our wisdom
Disappears.
Love
Makes fools of everyone:
All the rules
We make are broken.
Yes, Love,
Love changes everyone.
Live or perish
In its flame.
Love will never,
Never let you
Be the same.
The master builder is dead!
His head is all smashed in.... He fell right into the quarry.
I can't see him up there now.
This is terrible. So in fact he couldn't do it.
But he got right to the top.
My...my...master builder!
The toast of the town? 
The hit of the year? 
The birth of a star? 
The end of a career!
Darling, these things happen...
You turn round and tell us 
We're closed for two weeks!
Rose, I thought of everything...
You thought of nothing!
...There are posters in the streets 
And banners in the squares. 
Scream away, feel free, 
But at Ibsen, not at me...
Why did I agree 
To accept this bloody tour? 
The only thing in store 
Is two weeks of nothing!
Win some, lose some... 
What the hell...
Working till I drop 
For an audience of four: 
Three nuns and your mother...
It's no good complaining...
And she only bothered 
Because it was raining!
Love...
Don't call me 'Love'!
This isn't personal.
I don't care... The theatre's my life...
We will start the tour again 
In Lyon in two weeks! 
Rose, the people there 
Are all Ibsen mad, I swear! 
Come on, show me a smile!
God, I'm not in the mood...
What's a fortnight or so?
With no money or food...
Don't be glum...
Don't let's be downhearted!
Don't waste your breath.
We'll get by...
Now Rose, you must meet this young man! 
He's a dedicated fan -- 
Been in every evening!
Marcel, don't run away -- 
I can see your little plan.
It's an honor, mam'selle, 
I could watch you for hours... 
You can't have forgotten, 
I threw you the flowers... 
Mam'selle, seeing you on stage 
Has changed my life!
Join us in the cafe 
In the square!
See you... 
The cafe... 
The square...
Would you let me walk you there...?
Parlez-vous francais?
Je suis sad.
Parlez-vous francais?
I feel bad.
How do you say
"Ce soir vous etes
si belle"?
I only know
A word or so,
Like "Cat" and "School" --
Je suis fool.
Parlez-vous francais?
Please say "oui".
Parlez-vous francais?
Speak to me.
How do you say:
"Vous etes jolie,
Mam'selle?
Cherie,
Where do I commencer,
If you won't parler francais
with me?
Parlez-vous francais?
Say you do.
Parlez-vous francais?
Tell me true.
How do you say:
"Je suis unhappy
fella"?
Cherie,
Adieu to drinks and danser,
If you won't parler francais
with me.
Adieu to drinks and danser,
If you won't parler francais
with me.
That girl can really act! 
I could have sworn that she'd be here! 
She's got a great career -- 
She should play Salom?! 
Maybe I was mad, 
But she really seemed sincere...
Please say you're not angry, 
I just couldn't bear it! 
Please say you forgive me -- 
I want you to swear it! 
Of course I'm not angry -- 
I knew that you'd make it. 
There's plenty of time...
Here, that's heavy -- I'll take it.
I feel seventeen again!
So do I...
Seeing is believing,
And in my arms I see her:
She's here,
Really here,
Really mine now --
She seems at home here...
Seeing is believing,
I dreamt that it would be her:
At last
Life is full,
Life is find now...
Whatever happens,
One thing is certain:
Each time I see
A train go by,
I'll think of us,
The night, the sky
Forever...
He's young,
Very young,
But appealing --
I feel I know him...
Seeing is believing
And I like what I see here.
I like
Where I am,
What I'm feeling...
What are we doing?
Can you believe it?
A starving actress and
A star-struck boy --
Oh well, I might
As well enjoy
This moment...
Can you believe it?
Seeing is believing!
I never thought I'd be here
Is this
Really me?
Am I dreaming?
No way of knowing
Where this is leading...
It's fun forgetting
Who we are...
Who cares?
When now the world is far
Behind us...
Seeing is believing!
My life is just beginning!
We touched,
And my head
Won't stop spinning,
From winning
Your love!
Wish my arms were longer...
Or the gap was wider...
One more go and
That should do it...
One more try and there --
That does it!
You will rue the day
That you got me in this mess!
I've torn my one good dress!
You're really a charmer!
Rose, I know this seems
Like a scene from "Modern Times"...
The house is my uncle's --
All right, I was lying --
He's working in Paris,
He won't come here prying...
Oh Rose,
Rose, can't you see?
I would have said anything
To get you here with me...
Shall I make some coffee...?
One cup of fresh coffee
Buys two kisses --
Shall we have dinner?
Whatever happens,
We have this moment.
Who needs tomorrow,
When we have today?
Tonight we'll mean
The things we say
Forever...
Seeing is believing!
My life is just beginning!
We touched,
And my head
Won't stop spinning
From winning
Your love!
Damn the boy!
Damn the boy's
Damn-fool schoolboy antics!
Calm down now, George...
"Nephew Alex break in, stop.
Stealing household supplies, stop.
Living in sin, stop.
Please advise, stop."
My gardener, J?r?me!
How very nice!
How sweet!
How handy!
My bed!
My brandy!
He sounds like you --
I think you ought to introduce us!
Giulietta.
You'd better cancel supper at "Chez Max" --
This week was fun.
It shouldn't end like this...
This interlude was heaven...
How sad to think that it must end
When it had just begun...
George, you've got a painter's eye:
Everything is magnified!
I know you're all he's got,
But I don't see why you should go.
No, I must go.
Our little fling has done us good.
I have my paint.
You have your clay:
We both have work...
I know, I know.
Don't look so sad, George!
What times we've had, George!
There'll be more...
Ah yes.
That's true.
George...
There'll never be another you...
But, as you say, you are his guardian,
And sacrifices must be made.
We must part,
I'm afraid...
So put "Giulietta" thoughts behind you,
Forget about your broken heart!
Back to Venice...
Tend my art...
A love affair is not a lifetime.
It's calendars and clocks, my friend.
All good things
Have to end.
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this week will one day be.
Life goes on,
Love goes free.
Life goes on...
Love goes free...
This is what I ought to feel on stage...
Soaring up like snow-capped mountains...
I feel your beauty and your rage...
I could be those tumbling forests,
I could play those jagged hillsides...
Star of mountain,
Star of valley...
Would Madam care for breakfast?
Will croissants and fresh coffee do?
Wonderful view!
Whenever we see those mountains,
We will think of me and you...
George insists on magnificent views.
I think I should like your uncle...
Alex, she's beautiful. Who is she?
My aunt Delia. She was an actress too.
Delia! Was she famous?
Yes. But she died very young. That's why my uncle doesn't 
come down here very often. Too many memories.
Haven't I seen that somewhere before?
Not the one you're thinking of. That's in the Louvre. 
George did that one. Some people call it fraud, but he prefers to 
think of it as a tribute.
En garde!
Fifteen love!
Promise me today will never ever end!
Caviar! Anchovies! Peaches in brandy! We can have a banquet tonight!
When he does get down here, George doesn't believe in having to rough it.
I could get to like it here!
Let's not ever think of leaving!
Look at this. Pierrot. Carmen.
For the ballroom? Or the bedroom?
M?rim?e, "L'Occasion". I know this -- it's a wonderful play!
Really?
Let's do it. You can be the priest, I'll be Do?a Maria Colemenares.
But I don't know anything about the theatre.
I'll teach you. We'll do it. Tonight.
"What are you doing? Pull yourself together..."
This one is gorgeous!
It was her favorite dress...
He must have loved her so much.
Rose, leave things as they are...
I can just see her...
I feel I know her...
What does this letter contain? Give it to me.
But promise me not to read it while you are here. Read it 
this evening -- wait till this evening. Promise me. And 
tomorrow...no, never speak to me about it. If you give it 
back I shall punish myself for my folly...but for God's sake 
don't scold me.
Hand it over.
Have pity, I implore you. I have resisted as long as I could, 
but you mustn't open it here. Oh, God, what are you doing? 
Father Eugenio, I implore you. For pity's sake, give it back. 
Father, you are killing me.
What are you doing? Pull yourself together.
You must forgive this rude intrusion,
But I really felt I had to say "Well done"!
Oh, uncle George,
Come in, come in...
I've heard a million things about you...
And you are...?
I am Rose Vibert.
I hate to spoil your fun,
But I was dying for a gin --
But don't let me disturb you.
Oh, it's nice to meet you...
GEORGE (warming to the situation)
Surely M?rim?e's "L'Occasion"?
Lemon? Ice?
The perfect play.
Yet overstated...
Yes, that's true.
...And somehow dated now --
A living fossil!
How concise!
And Alex, you show promise.
Well, he is my pupil!
Ah, so this is your profession?
Rising star!
I'm sure, I'm sure.
I'm playing Hilde...
...In two weeks.
"The Master Builder"?
Yes.
What a courageous girl you are.
I hate to tear myself away,
But I must go and change --
Please promise me you'll stay.
I wouldn't dream of going far!
I'd like to be the first
To say "She's perfect!" --
A face like that
I haven't seen in years!
You must forgive us
For breaking in here.
I'll make it up, George,
Have no fear --
But please don't throw
Us out of here,
I beg you...
Seeing is believing --
I saw her and I loved her...
You must understand what I'm saying --
She's not just someone...
A love affair is not a crisis.
Enjoy it like a fine champagne --
Taste, but never let it
Cloud the brain.
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this time will one day be.
Life goes on,
Love goes free...
Some girls are like that,
They'll love you and leave you,
But Rose --
There's only one Rose...
I'm telling you,
This is not some schoolboy game --
My life will never be the same.
I look at you and
I knew it from the moment
I remember
That I saw her face...
How many times I've
There could
Felt this way --
Never be
Ah, the tricks
Any other
Love can play...
Love for me...
GEORGE
Alex, quick!
Some brandy!
You go...
I'll go...
Quickly...
I'm going...
Do forgive me...
So unlike me...
You looked just like her...
My wife...
Delia...
I thought for a moment...
The dress was hers,
But you look just as lovely --
It should be worn...
I've caused such drama here...
You mustn't think that...
It wasn't meant, my dear...
I'd better leave you two alone...
You're in no state to travel --
No,
You won't go anywhere.
You're staying in that chair.
Why spend the evening on your own?
Why, why must he spy on us?
It was perfect till he came!
Why, why must he ruin it?
...Of course, painting always was my first love.
Oh, to be so gifted.
When I'm dead they'll fetch a fortune.
We shall see.
I'd buy one now.
You'd better tell her...
Tell me what?
...Before you sell her one,
That they're just copies...
But by me!
I'd love to hear your poems!
I shall write one for you...
Byron isn't here to sue you.
Alex, please --
Don't interrupt.
At least I do things.
Yes, that's true.
...I see a few things through...
We often have disputes like these.
Did Alex ever tell you...
We'll be here till breakfast...
...Why his final year
At school was rather short?
No, not a word.
No, George, you couldn't...
Please go on!
No, George, you wouldn't dare...
I think it might amuse her...
I've had a splendid time,
A truly splendid time --
But I can see that I'm de trop...
I have a little tryst
Too tempting to resist,
And now I really ought to go...
I wish you both a charming fortnight,
Enjoy your little one-to-one --
Have your fling,
Have your fun...
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what these days will one day be...
Life goes on,
Love goes free...
I think I know where he's gone --
He's off to take his Italian lessons!
How could you have let me wear this dress?
He must think I have no feelings!
You should have said what he was like...
I must seem a heartless woman!
I must seem a soulless creature!
Anyway, let's not have a scene..
What was that?
What?
There.
Listen.
It's her ghost.
I'm frightened.
Don't be silly. I'll go and have a look.
Well?
There's nothing there. I suppose it must have been a rat.
I can't sleep in a house full of rats!
Well, I don't want you to sleep just yet...
Alex. Not now.
Rose, where are you?
Rose, where are you?
I've been out walking.
And what a day --
So crisp and clear!
And you're not spending it in here!
Let's breathe some mountain air!
I thought you'd left me...
What do you say?
I had a dream you'd left me...
Good idea?
Good idea!
Pas de tendresse
Et pas de joie
Loin d'ici,
Loin de toi.
Rien de plus triste
Que mes soupirs
Lorsque vient le joir
Ou il me faut partir
Chanson d'enfance,
Tu vis toujours dans ma coeur,
Toi, la plus douce!
Toi, la plus tendre.
Marcel wants me in Lyon...
He says that I'm needed today...
Well, it must be important...
I won't go.
I don't want to.
I'll ignore it.
How can I desert you?
It's all so unfair,
So unfeeling!
How can you say that?
Don't be a fool, Rose!
You can't put me before your whole career!
You can't let feelings interfere --
You must go!
I'll pick up my script and my dress.
"A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this week will one day be..." 
George...you're wrong...
Marcel -- how could he have known where she was? 
Unless she told him...or sent this herself.... And there was I, 
completely taken in, when she was going all along...
No, she couldn't...
Oh God, she wouldn't...
Who's feeling lucky?
Twenty out of twenty
And a prize could be yours!
See "Marie the Monkey"
With the poisonous claws!
There's a prize
To be won!
Take a risk,
Take a ride!
Right this way,
Have a go!
Try your luck,
And step inside!
If you reach
For the moon,
If you aim
For the sky,
Then the moon
And the sky
Can be yours --
Come on and try!
Everybody loves a hero!
Let's hear it for the man with the gun!
Everybody loves a hero...
How you've grown!
It's been two years.
You should have phoned --
Your uncle isn't here.
I might have guessed!
And such a splendid uniform!
The same old paintings.
Madame will be so thrilled to meet you --
I'll go and tell her.
"Giulietta Trapani"...
Life has changed!
Since those two met
He lives life to the full!
Well, good for him!
She has made him young again!
Where is he now, then?
He's doing up the country villa --
They plan to live there.
Now, tell me, do you still like omelettes?
Won't be a moment!
And so he got his wicked way with that Italian girl --
He hasn't lost his touch...
Well, hello...
I should have known
Where you were hiding --
You like the good life,
George likes trinkets!
God, what a fool
I was to love you!
What was all my searching for?
It's never hard to find a whore!
Well, if it makes you happy, think it...
You scheming bitch...
The truth is we're a perfect pair.
Because he's rich...
Shout and scream --
I don't care...
You could have let me know...!
Your uncle's shown me new horizons...
Well, didn't I?
And as a lover he is perfect too.
Another lie!
He takes his time.
Unlike you.
I wasn't good enough?
Why can't you listen
And come to your senses?
It's George...
I really love George...
He's made me a 
Better, fuller, stronger person,
I have never been as happy!
Or, indeed, as wealthy.
Look, I don't need your uncle's money!
And I could have a thousand lovers!
Yet I've been faithful and I'm happy --
More faithful than he'll ever be:
It's not as if he's married me...
I'd better go...
I'm sorry...
It was a shock...
Try and understand,
And it won't hurt you so much.
At least admit you loved me once...
Of course I did.
I may even love you now...
George gives me so much...
But he gets so little from me...
But with you I made an impression
That will last you a lifetime...
So change my life for me again...
Here we go again!
Heaven knows when she'll be back --
That girl has got a knack
Of keeping you guessing!
Madame will soon be here,
But she says you are to leave:
Your uncle is coming,
You'd better get going...
So why all the panic?
Why shouldn't I be here?
She's scared that his heart
Couldn't stand all this drama...
Well, it's hardly a shock
If my uncle sees me here...
That girl is unbelievable!
Was last night the sort of thing
She could just forget?
It would be hard to find
A more capricious mind...
What are you doing here?
All right, where have you been?
Will you please disappear?
What the hell do you mean?
Leave me, leave me!
I don't want George exposed
To some unpleasant scene.
If I can't have you, no one will.
Killing you would be a pleasure.
So all you're fit for is to kill?
Go on and pull the trigger,
See if I care!
Come on, soldier!
Be a hero!
You never loved me?
Does it matter?
You never meant it?
Who remembers?
And now you hate me...
Go away, you little
Schoolboy...
My only genuine Matisse!
Thank God...
No damage done...
Would someone kindly tell me
What on earth has happened?
He lost his head,
The gun went off,
She's bleeding badly,
Use your scarf --
Here, let me help...
You'd better phone the doctor.
I should never have come back here...
Oh, don't talk such nonsense!
I'll bow out now --
It's the decent thing to do.
Don't be absurd.
I'm a disaster...
Oh, come, come!
...It wouldn't last a week --
She'd be far better off with you.
You two have your lives before you.
It would end in murder...
I'm too old for her --
It's high time I withdrew.
Your place is here.
The jowls are dropping...
It's the light.
...The paunch needs propping up --
She'd be far better off with you.
Your words are generous and selfless,
But alas untrue --
She'd be far better off with you.
You are steeped in wit and wisdom.
Well, I've learnt the odd thing...
You could teach George Bernard Shaw
A thing or two!
I had a go...
You've dined with Garbo...
Only twice.
...Translated "La Boheme" --
She'd be far better off with you.
You're athletic.
You're distinguished.
You don't cheat at croquet.
You're more seasoned.
You can skate.
You're in "Who's Who".
Just half an inch.
We're talking drivel.
So we are.
Can't we be civilized?
She'd be far better off with you.
Your words are generous and selfless,
But alas untrue.
It's only Rose that matters!
Just take a look; there's no comparison
Between us two --
She'd be far better off with you!
...And then with a swift karate-chop 
I removed his gun -- 
You should have been there! 
Poor chap didn't know what hit him...
Still, George! 
If you can't keep your tongue still, 
You will have the face of Edith Sitwell!
Ah well, they're happy... 
It's for the best anyway... 
Let's face it, 
He's the man for her, 
And I'm the man for you, dear...
Don't talk such nonsense -- 
You'll never stop loving her. 
You don't fool me: 
You're quite besotted with her...
Stop. Wait. Good. Please... 
Still, George...
With my scarf I made a tourniquet -- 
Shantung silk, but worth the sacrifice -- 
It stemmed the flow, the arm was saved, and...
Still, George, 
Rose would seem the kind of lady 
Who would live through any blood-bath...
Darling, it's over -- 
So don't be so cynical. 
I don't suppose that you've become a nun 
Since last I saw you...
Wouldn't you love that! 
Perpetual chastity!
So tell me, 
Have you found some young Adonis?
Stop. Wait. Good. Please...
No, George.
Time and light are fading -- 
Shouldn't we make the most of 
Every precious moment? 
Life is sweet and slow and still and...
I'm not leaving here till I get what I came for...it's a 
scandal...out of my way...heaven help him if he won't 
pay...who are you pushing...I got here first...all I want 
is what's fair...he had better be there...
For heaven's sake! 
Who's making all that mayhem?
Thank God you're here! 
We've got trouble with Rose --
Are you certain that
This is the man?
Running up bills 
Wherever she goes!
Is he the one
Footing the bill?
(to the others)
This is the man I was 
Looking for,
Is this the man?
This is your man!
Can you be certain that
This is the man?
Is this the right man?
This is the man 
Who will pay for 
The eighty-one phone calls!
I beg of you, pay!
My poor mother is dying!
She loses her job if
These bills don't get settled!
If I lose my job, then...
This is the man
Who will pay for
The codeine and dressings!
I've called the police, there
We'll call the police if...
Are eight in the lobby!
The Doge's Suite!
Beluga caviar!
Twenty thousand lire!
You are the man, 
I understand, 
Who can clear my expenses. 
Here they are: 
Thirty thousand lire!
Forty thousand!
Fifty thousand!
Nineteen...
Twenty thousand lire!
Twenty-three...
Thirty thousand lire!
Forty-eight...
Forty thousand!
Forty-nine...
Fifty thousand!
George, I'm sorry...She's been very ill.
George...George... 
My life is draining... 
Away...
We'd best be on our way -- 
We'll leave you three alone...
So this is Rose Vibert.
The famous Rose Vibert.
I have to talk to her. 
Sit down and talk to her. 
This can't go on another day.
Rose, what can I do with you? 
Wreaking havoc left and right -- 
It's absurd! 
She must change her ways, 
She must pass this passing phase -- 
Problem child... 
Running wild...
Rose, I ought to strangle you! 
But there's a style about that girl 
That stops me in my tracks. 
Heaven knows why she 
Wants to waste her life with me...
And yet if she went off, 
If she set herself free, 
As I've told her she should... 
Where on earth would I be?
You'd be lost, my friend,
And so would she...
...And he said to me 
He really ought to buy that vineyard...
Please, Rose. 
Don't you think you ought 
To take a little rest 
From George's foibles?
Well, you'll have to learn to live with it. 
That and all his other pet obsessions: 
God and Trollope, 
Other women...
Please, Rose!
George is a remarkable man. 
He was there when I thought I had no one. 
He saw me through my darkest moments. 
He made me talk about my husband.
We had been married five days... 
He drove like the wind... 
Not any more...
But George was always there, 
No matter when or where. 
He stopped me feeling so alone...
When did you meet him?
One evening at Harry's bar -- 
He wore a silver tie pin 
And a smile that was even brighter...
I know that tie pin -- 
It catches on everything!
And as for all those paint rags...
Heaven help us!
We deserve a medal!
Nice to see that George has settled in: 
Fifteen novels on the go, as always! 
Used to drive me to distraction...
Please, Rose!
Last year he forgot my birthday, 
So I rearranged his bookmarks...
George dear, we're talking -- 
We don't need you hovering.
My darling, you're completely right --
We're doing fine without you.
I get the picture. 
Condemn me to solitude!
You'll find some things to keep you occupied.
We'll call you if we need you!
Time and light are fading -- 
Shouldn't we make the most 
Of every precious moment? 
Life is sweet and slow and still 
And perfect! 
All the more, now our man George 
Has brought the two of us together!
I never imagined she'd be like that -- 
Your lady friend comes as a sweet surprise... 
A wonderfully sweet surprise...
Take a deep breath and prepare yourself... 
I've been such a trusting fool... 
Those wretched investments I made 
Have gone down the drain... 
After today, there'll be no more champagne... 
The ways of the world are cruel...
If I ask a question, 
Will you promise...? 
You must promise... 
That the answer to my question is "yes"...
Yes, I'll say yes...
Take a deep breath and prepare yourself... 
My mind is in such a mess... 
But really, George, 
All that I wanted to ask was this: 
Would you be willing to marry me?
I've already told you. 
Yes.
"...I now pronounce you man and wife."
My dears, congratulations!
Here's to the happy couple!
Here's to happy days! 
And even better nights!
You lucky man!
Well, now we've done it!
And, oh, what fun it was...
And now I claim my best man's rights! 
Bravo, bravo
"News takes time to reach us here. 
So you're married. 
How time flies. 
And George will be a father soon. 
That was more of a surprise. 
Perhaps one day we'll meet again, 
If I ever leave the army..."
Live or perish 
In its flame, 
Love will never, 
Never let you 
Be the same...
Love will never, 
Never let you 
Be the same!
Natalia Petrovna.... Unhappy woman, for the first time in 
your life...you are in love.
If Turgenev were here 
He'd order champagne! 
A triumph, my dear!
What a night to end with...
Rose, you were incredible!
They seemed to like it...
I have never heard a crowd 
Make a noise like that!
It's your best production!
Are we in the mood
For debauchery and food?
Marcel, you are a dear 
But a most forgetful man! 
I've told you that I plan 
To drive through the country.
Well done, darling... 
Well done you...
Have a lovely night! 
Come and see me when you can.
Now come along, Hugo.
I'm ready, don't worry. 
I've done all the packing, 
There's no need to hurry.
Tonight was a wonder!
A soaring sensation!
The best thing is having 
My friends' admiration
The perfect leading lady:
Unique and true and towering!
Magnetic, overpowering!
The star the crowds adore!
If they could only know you:
Your humor and humility...
Your strength and your fragility...
They'd love you even more...
Tonight was a wonder!
All the dreams we worked for
Have come true!
My shining leading lady!
Bravo, bravo, bravo!
I owe so much to you.
Have I changed?
No, not at all.
You're too polite. 
This face has had its day.
Don't be so silly!
Is it "General Alex" yet?
I hardly think so. 
Two weeks without a script or camera! 
I can't believe it! 
And then another madcap movie...
With Monsieur Cocteau... 
George is sweet. 
He says I'm like his favorite Juran?on: 
Very strong and beautiful -- 
But hardly very sweet or subtle, 
and not too heady...
His head must be extremely strong, then -- 
I'm drunk already!
What a life!
You're telling me!
What does Jenny make of all this fame? 
Ask her yourself.
Do you think I ought to come?
My darling, you've become so bourgeois -- 
We'll have to change that!
The same old Alex... 
I should be flattered... 
You're never one to let a chance slip by...
I'll never understand you till the day I die...
I'm sorry...
I think by now I'm old enough 
To put myself to bed. 
Why don't you go and forge 
Another masterpiece instead?
Oh, Jenny, you're a monster! 
I should have had a son! 
It seems, alas, a father's lot...
...Is not a happy one!
You know I need my donkey.
Why can't you just count sheep?
All right, you have your donkey -- 
Now will you go to sleep?
I'm really thrilled for Mummy! 
Weren't they wonderful reviews? 
She'll be the toast of Paris! 
Mummy's always in the news!
You're right, it is amazing 
How the work keeps flooding in, 
With appearances in London 
And movies in Berlin.
Now off you go to bed -- 
I'll wake you when I hear the car!
Look, Jenny, go to bed -- 
God, what a chatterbox you are!
Jenny, 
You're a miracle! 
Is there nothing you conceal? 
Jenny, 
You astonish me! 
Never hiding 
What you feel...
Other pleasures... 
And I've known many... 
Afternoons 
In warm Venetian squares, 
Brief encounters, 
Long siestas... 
Pleasures old and new 
Can't compare with you.
You amaze me! 
Where did you come from? 
You do things 
Champagne could never do. 
Crystal winters, 
Crimson summers... 
Other pleasures -- 
I would trade them all 
For you.
Pleasures old and new 
Can't compare with you...
Wild mimosa... 
The scent of evening... 
Shuttered rooms 
With sunlight breaking through... 
Crazy soir?es... 
Lazy Sundays... 
Other pleasures... 
I would trade them all 
For you.
Sailing off 
In the night 
On a silver lake... 
Taking more 
From this life 
Than I ought to take... 
Other pleasures... 
I would trade them all 
For you.
Quickly! 
She's here now! 
Don't be an old lazybones!
Good Lord! 
The time! 
For once she's managed 
To arrive ahead of schedule!
Wait till you see 
What I've got for you, 
Darling.
And wait till you see 
What I've got for you...
I don't believe this...
I don't believe this...
Good God, I wondered what had happened to you!
Rose, you really should have let me know!
Dear boy, you must meet Jenny!
Hello, cousin. 
Nice to meet you.
So you're the soldier?
This is Alex.
You remember.
Yes, of course.
He saw my last performance.
She really was phenomenal.
"A truly blazing star"!
Rose, you're a wonder!
All the dreams we've worked for 
Have come true
"Big surprise: 
I can't be with you this weekend. 
But don't be cross -- 
You should thank me. 
You wouldn't find me much fun. 
It seems my life is one enormous drama! 
Men are such a dreadful nuisance... 
I'll call you when I'm me again. 
C'est la vie, 
C'est l'amour..."
There is more to love,
So much more,
Than simply making love --
That's easy.
Gazing into eyes,
Pretty eyes,
Which could be any eyes --
That's crazy.
Hands are just hands,
A face is just a face...
They come and go --
They're easy to replace...
There is more to love,
So much more,
Than moon-struck escapades --
That's nothing.
There is peace of mind,
So much peace,
In quiet company --
That's something.
Everyone but him
Seems wrong for me...
Every time I feel
There has to be
More...
If I could hear
The music I heard then,
I'd never let
It fade away again...
Now each time
Love reaches out to me,
I can only feel
There has to be
So much more
To love...
There is more to love,
So much more...
I trust you're staying for the vintage?
Oh, he mustn't miss it!
Alex, promise me you won't run off just yet!
There's lots of room!
I'm in no hurry -- 
If it won't worry you... 
This could be something you'll regret!
Oh, no! 
That's really disappointing!
What on earth's the matter?
Giulietta won't be with us this weekend.
What's happened now?
Same situation.
That girl's relationships 
Are too involved to comprehend!
Looks like I'll never meet your friend.
One day you will, old chap.
It's time I took my nap.
Good Lord, the time has really flown!
I'd better run along. 
You'll have to manage on your own!
Part of me was always in these hills... 
This is where my eyes were opened... 
When life was young and we had time... 
I wonder why she brought me back here... 
Why invite me? 
Why entice me? 
Why rekindle old emotions...?
I am a mermaid
With golden hair...
I've never seen one like you!
Not all us mermaids
Have silver tails --
I have no tail at all!
Well, I've never,
Seen any mermaids
With knobbly knees!
I'd say this tale
Was a touch too tall,
Maybe a touch too tall...
Sailors would smash on
My jagged rock,
Lured by my siren's song...
It isn't the
Song of the siren
That tortures men --
That's where your theory
Goes sadly wrong,
That's where it all goes wrong...
I thought you'd know better,
You know nothing
About mermaids.
You know nothing
About sailors...
I do!
Much more than you!
If you were a sailor
And heard my song,
Would you be lured by me?
I wouldn't be
Foolish enough to
Go near your rock --
I'd steer my galleon out to sea...
...Lonely and lost at sea...
Say the word! 
Say it now! 
Nice and loud!
What the hell, then -- 
Uncle!
Jenny you're a monster! 
You ought to be locked up!
Before I am, 
I think I'll dress for dinner -- 
You mix the drinks...
She needs a Paris education. 
I've told you time and time again.
And wouldn't that be cozy? 
You could then have your very own Parisienne!
Alex, how can you even think 
Of moving her away from this place? 
I mean, Alex, you of all people have found 
That leaving here is hard to face.
Yes, I love it here and always will... 
But Rose, it's not the views 
Or the vines that keep me here... 
I stay year after year 
For something far deeper... 
Being in this house 
Makes the past seem very near...
...When the world was a playground 
All train-rides and laughter, 
And love in the morning...
...And armagnac after...
Since leaving the army 
And being around you, 
I know I'm reliving 
The night that I found you...
But George... 
I couldn't hurt George... 
Oh Alex, you know by now 
How much I love him...
So what is it 
You feel for Hugo?
Please understand I'm not in love with him. 
He's a friend, he makes me laugh... 
That's all it is. 
Alex, can't you see 
That you mean much more to me?
Alex, that's why I won't 
Play the lover with you. 
What I did to you once 
Wasn't easy to do -- 
But I only have one life, 
Not two...
I want to be
The first man you remember,
I want to be
The last man you forget.
I want to be
The one you always turn to,
I want to be
The one you won't regret.
May I be first
To say you look delightful?
May I be first
To dance you round the floor?
The very first
To see your face by moonlight?
The very first
To walk you to your door?
Well, young man, I'd be delighted!
There is nothing I would rather do!
What could be a sweeter memory
Than sharing my first dance with you?
I want to be
The first man you remember...
The very first
To sweep me off my feet.
I want to be
The one you always turn to...
The first to make
My young heart miss a beat.
Seems the stars are far below us...
The moon has never felt so close before...
Our first dance will be forever...
And may it lead to many more!
I want to be
The first man you remember...
The very first
To sweep me off my feet.
I want to be
The one you always turn to
The first to make
My young heart miss a beat.
I want to be
The one you always turn to
I want to be
The one you won't regret...
The very first...
The very first...
Now that's what I call a wall!
It's a masterpiece!
It's Picasso!
Except it's straight...
Hugo, we should call you Samson!
He has many talents.
How you didn't break your back I'll never know!
No, nor will I!
Thank God for Sundays!
Our wall will be the talk of Pau!
Two more days, then off to Paris.
And a school for Jenny.
Didn't Jenny look a picture in that dress?
Indeed she did.
So like her mother... 
Shades of another time... 
Of vintage nights --
But I digress...
Good Lord, the time! 
Ah well, God bless...
Alex, this has gone on long enough -- 
What I mean is you and Jenny.
I'll be off now... 
See you both tomorrow...
Since you came, she's truly blossomed -- 
But, my friend, a flower is fragile... 
Heaven help you if you hurt her...
Why all this concern? 
God, you're hardly ever here! 
Your whole life is your career, 
And nothing else matters.
My career? 
We wouldn't eat if I had no career. 
You know that George lost everything. 
I do it all for George and Jenny. 
I thought you knew that.
All right, I'm sorry.
Can't you see? 
What we three have is something very rare. 
In a word, it's happiness. 
Nothing in the world will ever 
Tear apart the sweet existence 
We have spent a lifetime building!
Rose, let me explain to you... 
Yes, I can't deny the feelings that I have... 
But what's wrong with that?
Rose, I'd never harm the girl...
You were once prepared to do 
A lot of harm to me...
You cannot compare 
This with our insane affair... 
What I wanted from you 
Was both body and soul...
Aren't you trying to play 
An identical role?
This is one thing that I will control.
Do you remember the first time you fell in love? 
Did it make you happy or sad? 
Did you waste away and lie awake all night?
Yes, I remember... 
I cannot forget... 
It's haunted my life since then...
"Pas de tendresse 
Et pas de joie, 
Loin d'ici, 
Loin de toi.
Rien de plus triste 
Que mes soupirs, 
Lorsque vient le jour 
O? il me faut partir..."
How do you know that?
Mummy used to sing it to me. 
That was her love song. 
Her very first love song...
Love, 
Love changes everything: 
How you feel and 
What you do...
What... 
What would you say to me, 
If I told you 
I loved you...?
Then I'd have to say to you: 
You are bright and sweet and foolish... 
Yes, love, 
Love changes everything, 
But not always 
For the best -- 
Love can sometimes 
Be a most 
Unwelcome guest...
You don't believe that. 
You know you're fooling yourself. 
Why not be honest?
Alex, 
Be honest...
"...Beluga caviar... 
My finest vintage champagne... 
And then a night of dance... 
My ashes to be scattered 
Among the vines at sunset..."
Oh, do stop planning your wake! 
You're bound to outlive us all!
"...My funeral oration to be written by Giulietta 
Trapani..."
Rose, we should talk -- 
I've got something on my mind. 
It's Jenny, 
Jenny and Alex -- 
The whole thing's unnatural 
For a girl of her age...
You needn't be anxious: 
He's explained all this. 
And she's no longer a child. 
It's just that he's younger 
And you're getting jealous. 
Am I right? 
Anyway, I'm filming in Paris, 
And it's her birthday -- 
We promised we would take her to the circus -- 
George, you know that I'm right.
Maybe you're right... 
Look, you're free to keep your lover 
And your noisy Paris clique. 
A man who's pushing eighty 
Is not exactly chic... 
But Jenny's all I have now -- 
Don't let him take her from me...
My darling George, I love you! 
How dramatic can you be!
You think that I'm dramatic? 
Wait. 
If we don't take some action, 
We'll be too late...
Take the journey of a lifetime!
It's only just a drum-roll away!
On the journey of a lifetime
Every day's a high-wire day!
If you've got what it takes,
The stars and streamers are yours!
Take a risk in the ring
And feel the thrill of applause!
If you reach
For the moon,
If you aim
For the stars,
Then the moon
And the sky,
Can be yours --
Come on and try!
There's a prize
To be won
Take a risk,
Take a ride,
Right this way,
Have a go,
Try your luck --
And step inside!
If you reach
For the moon,
If you aim

Love, and your
World can become
A madhouse.
Love and your
World can become
A circus.
Love turns around...
Jenny, your
Love is a
Drug that I dare
Not take, a
Drug to make me mad...
Rose, I'd never
Harm the girl.
Love
Has turned my
World around,
And my
World now turns round
Alex...
Love should not
Be used as a weapon.
Why, Alex,
Why can't you
See it's George you're...?
Breaking
And burning...
Breaking
And bleeding...
In the name of
Love...
Love is a
Knife. It's a curse.
A cancer.
To love is to
Hate letting
Go...
Jenny, I can
Never share your
Love...
And I'm falling,
I am suddenly falling,
And my story
Is older than the stars...
Suddenly falling
I can feel myself falling...
Down into this
Madhoise
Of love...
Suddenly falling
I can feel myself falling...
In this
Madhouse of
Love...
Come on, Jenny. 
That's enough now. 
Jenny, even mermaids 
Have to sleep.
I am a mermaid 
With golden hair...
Come on, Jenny. 
Be a good girl.
Alex, let me hold you... 
There's so much I want to say...
I want you here forever, 
In my arms and in my life, 
To belong to you entirely... 
You know we're not just cousins...
We are just cousins, Jenny, 
And you're fifteen years old.
It's not as if I don't know passion 
From living in our house... 
I've learnt that feelings can run deep...
We'll talk tomorrow -- 
Go to sleep.
Taking more... 
Than I ought to take...
What are you doing? 
Don't even think it... 
You have no right to feel this way, 
And yet... 
I love her, and I must not love her... 
I wish to God we'd never met... 
She ought to be 
The last one I should think of...
I know he's 
Up there with her now...
She ought to be 
The last one I should love...
If he is, 
My God, I'll kill him...
She ought to be 
The last one I should care for...
I should have 
Stopped this long ago...
The very last...
Selfish little cradle-snatcher... 
Twisted, rotten, heartless monster... 
Filthy, filthy callous bastard...
I was right... 
He's in there... 
There he is... 
He's in there...
Jenny, my Jenny, 
I can't let him take you, 
I...
George...George...
I was saying goodnight to Jenny, 
When I heard a noise in the passage...
He must have fallen 
And had a heart attack.
No, it's hopeless...
He was listening -- 
Jenny mustn't know. 
If she asks you, 
Say he died while sitting by the fire -- 
Help me to move him in there.
George was an original man.
He did not want to change human life.
He rejoiced in the way we are made.
He rejoiced in the way we are made.
He did not look forward to heaven --
He was happy with the earth.
He loved and understood
The flesh, food, wine, love...
He lived for today and firmly believed:
If death were given a voice,
That voice would scream through the sky:
Live while you may for I am coming...
So...
Hand me the wine and the dice,
I want my carnival now,
While I have thirst and lust for living!
So gather all you can reap,
Before you're under the plough --
The hand of death is unforgiving!
Hand me the wine and the dice,
While there are grapes on the vine --
Life is a round of endless pleasures!
The end is always in sight,
But it tastes better with wind --
Why pay your life in tiny measures?
Hand me the wine and the dice,
The time is racing away --
There's not a taste that's not worth trying!
And if tommorow it ends,
I won't have wasted today --
I will have lived like I am dying.
What was that?
What?
There. 
Listen.
There's nothing there. I suppose it must have been a rat.
So what do you propose to do, then? 
Get married while she's still at school? 
Tell her now. 
Don't be cruel.
There has to be a way to say it... 
Common sense can be so cold...
Common sense 
Says: be bold...
Yes, it's a crime to make her love me -- 
But surely, it's just as bad to leave her... 
And yet, that can be the only answer -- 
The whole damn thing's got out of hand...
The only crime that I'm aware of 
Would be to let our moment die -- 
Tell her now. 
Tell her why.
"A memory of a happy moment, 
That's what this time will one day be" -- 
Tell her that. 
Then you're free.
Will you still be here when I get back?
Yes. But don't be too long, Alex. Don't be too long.
Anything but lonely,
Anything but empty rooms.
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is there?
Anything but lonely,
Anything but only me.
Quiet years in too much space:
That's the thing that's hard to face,
And...
You have a right to go,
But you should also know
That I won't be alone for long.
Long days with nothing said
Are not what lie ahead --
I'm sorry, but I'm not that strong.
Anything but lonely,
Anything but passing time.
Lonely's what I'll never be,
While there's still some life in me,
And...
I'm still young, don't forget,
It isn't over yet --
So many hearts for me to thrill.
If you're not here to say
How good I look each day,
I'll have to find someone who will.
Anything but lonely,
Anything but empty rooms.
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is
there...?
Just promise one thing.
All right.
What is it?
Don't ask me questions...
You must promise first...
I can't
I must know what it is.
Don't leave me!
