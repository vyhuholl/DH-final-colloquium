I don't mind admitting the last place i expected to finish up was as an exhibit in the chamber of horrors and not even at the main HQ but in Black Pole if you please, nowhere to be found on my long list of desirable places to spen the week ends and yet, not so long ago I have a fair claim to be the most popular man in London,

Stephen Ward your friendly ostheopat

I can fix your lowerback for you
Also known for high class portraiter
and you'll find that that's not all I do
Whinston Churchil, Ava Garner
different comptoirs same predicament
Ghandi was another regular
called me his prefferred medicament
I invented a new way of life
some might call it unconventional
all that stuffing best word englishness
I know something more consentual
you'll be wondering what I'm doing here
stuck between Hitler and the Acid bath murderer
let me warn you if the consecuences if you get up
the nose of the stablishment
if you give them what they're looking for
they'll be greatfull
There's another way to heaven
I am here right now
Look around

So many pleasures for the taking

I intend to stay in heaven
While the sun is high
Heaven has turned out to be
This side of the sky

There's another way of thinking
I believe in love
I believe
Life should be lived before it's over

On this golden summer evening
River flowing by
Maybe heaven's always been
This side of the sky

Never seen a place so peaceful
Like a fairytale
We've no sign
Of any dragons in the forest

I'm not used to being happy
Makes me want to cry
Never knew of this was waiting
This side of the sky

There's another way of living
I'm believe in love
I believe
Life must be lived before it's over

There's another way to heaven
No one has to die
Maybe heaven's always been
This side of the sky

There's another way to heaven
We don't have to die
If we're lucky
We find heaven
This side of the sky
