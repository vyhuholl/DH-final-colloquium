You must be mistaken
It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday
He's doing some deal up in Baltimore now
I hate it when he's away
You must be mistaken
I'm sure that you are
There's more than one car with stickers on
And lots of young guys wear corduroy pants
And I'd know if he hadn't gone
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before
If I'm not mistaken, it started last year
I'm not very clear how it began
I noticed a change but I just closed my eyes
As only a woman can
No, I didn't dig deep
I did not want to know
Well, you don't interfere
When you're scared of the things you might hear
When he's back, you think I will end it right there and then?
Well, my fair weather friend, you're wrong again
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before
Just what time of night do you call this?
No I'm not alright... I have had enough... Don't you interrupt
Let me finish I said let me finish
I'm tired of waiting for something to happen
Sorry... I can't live like this any longer
I am not a saint... I've said this before but you haven't heard
Let me finish... this time let me finish
Wait a minute! You'll get your turn
It's not often I get the chance to talk
I forget the last time I saw a person
Fifth Avenue might as well be Mars!
Never thought I would ever say
Keep Manhattan... give me Muswell Hill
I'd have had more fun with Neville Braitwaite
That old devil Neville always put me first (on occasions)
No I don't want a drink!
Not yet
I've rehearsed these next lines for ages
Why do I feel cold? I suppose it's nerves... I don't need a drink
Let me finish... I said let me finish
I've had it to here with your business problems
I don't want to dance with your boss once a year
I don't care if the neighbours hear
You always say we British are too reserved
I need a change I must do something new or I will go mad
Not now! Let me finish... you'll get your chance to call me a child
We've got to make decisions... don't touch me get away
Don't you touch me!
This isn't a joke for God's sake stop smiling
Don't run out we won't solve anything that way
Come back... can't we sit and talk this thing over?
It's not the end of the world if I lose him
It just might seem so tonight
It's not the end of the world
Nothing like it
I'll soon be the same old me
People get over worse things
And I'll get over this
In no time at all you can bet I'll be laughing
Well I wouldn't give him the pleasure of seeing me cry
Why should I?
It's not the end of the world to feel lonely
I suppose this feeling goes
It's not the end of the world to change rainbows
I'll be fine when I find mine
It's not the end of the world to be free
It's not the end of the world to be me
Mum I've got a lot to tell you
Me and Joe have had a bust up
This will be the last letter with the post mark stamped N.Y.
I've met a film producer
Please don't laugh
His name is Sheldon
He's what the people here all call a real together guy
He is off to California
And he wants me to go with him
Oh thanks for your last letter
I was thrilled to hear from you
The pictures of the garden are all absolutely lovely
And incidentally Sheldon's mum loves Mantovani too
Mum I'm not at all unhappy
One day soon when I am settled
I want you both to come out
You will love it in L.A.
I've got to buy some swimsuits
So I must rush down to Macy's
I will write to you again
When I have found a place to stay
I'll walk your dog
You can be the first one in the shower
We'll make love every hour
Beneath your Van Gogh
I'll park the car
I'll whistle while the eggs are fryin'
Dance while your shirts are dryin'
Waltz or tango?
Let me move in and let's get this show rolling
I'll talk to your plants
I'll even go bowling
There is nothing I wouldn't do
I'll be the perfect little lady for you
Sheldon Bloom
Make some room
Won't say a word
When you're watching Spencer Tracey
I'll learn to dig Count Basie
Nothing to it
I'll start to jog
If that's what you want to take up
I'll stop wearing make up
I can do it!
When you meditate I promise you I'll be quiet
I won't eat eclairs
I'll share your sugar free diet
There is nothing I wouldn't do
I'll be the perfect little lady for you
Pass the key
Sheldon B
No horoscopes
You won't ever hear me mention Pisces
There won't be any crises
You can bet that
I'll give up pork
And I will tune that old viola
Quote things from Emile Zola
I must get that
I will make you feel well when you feel fluey
Be your analyst when your head's real screwy
There is nothing I wouldn't do
I'll be the perfect little lady for you
Sheldon dear
I like it here.
Capped teeth and Caesar Salad
Good old Beverly Hills
With every deal that's done
An award is won
You can rent a car
Or rent a star
Suntans and Sunday brunches
Sprinklers sprinkle away
Careers are being hyped
Before the scripts are typed
I'll call you back and have a nice day
Capped teeth and Caesar Salad
Spotless Beverly Hills
If someone takes a walk
All the neighbours talk
Every man and beast
Came from out East
Egos and valet parking
Newsmen gossip away
If you don't mean a thing
You'll find your phone won't ring
I'll call you back and have a nice day
("Hello... Mr. Stigwood's Office - No, I'm afraid he's at a screening. If you would like to leave word we'll get right back to you. Thank you for calling - Have a nice day.")
Capped teeth and Caesar Salad
Prime time Beverly Hills
The cost of land's so high
You can't afford to die
When you feel bad there
You dial-a-prayer
Earthquakes and English muffins
Ulcers popping away
It's like a fairy tale
Long as you don't inhale
I'll call you back and have a nice day.
You made me think you were in love
You made me think that I was all you'd need
You made me think you were in love
I could've sworn you'd give the world to be mine
Looked that way
Till you called today
You made me think you were in love
You could've used your charm on someone else
You made me think you were the one
You know I built a lot of dreams on your smile
How can you do the things you do?
Last thing at night you used to call me
Soon as you woke up you called me
I made you laugh and we both liked the same things
You always looked happy... very happy
Whatever you wanted I thought I could give you
I ought to hate you but I want you even more
What did you do it for?
You made me think you were in love
We're both too old to play these kind of games
I should be sorry that I met you
You made me mad but I'm not over you yet
And I don't know
Mum, I know you'll think I'm potty
But at last I think I've found him
He's young but he's mature
And you will love him I can tell
He says one day we'll marry
And I don't think I should rush him
But if he gets his skates on
We can have some kids as well
There are lots of things I miss, mum
No-one makes a normal sandwich
You need Goliath's mouth to eat
The ones New Yorkers buy
I long to find a drink
That hasn't got an ice cube in it
And for an English sausage
I swear I would gladly die
Anyway, as I was saying
He just can't sit still a minute
He's not like Neville Braithwaite
This one likes to dance all night
He does a lot of travelling
And when he goes I miss him
For once I think it's safe to say
I'm doing something right.
If I can let go.
I will see you in a week or two
It's late
You better get going
Take care of yourself and call anytime you feel that you're missing me
I can only say what I always say at these goodbyes
Come back with the same look in your eyes
I know you have your work to do
And I know how much you love me
But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night
If there comes a time just remember I'm the kind that cries
Come back with the same look in your eyes
Everything we want we find in each other
We would be fools to let love slip away
Everything's so right I'm scared that we might lose it one day
We could never keep things from one another
You know all the feelings that are in my heart
It's not easy... it's not easy
When you have to be apart
So I'll see you in a week or two
It's late
You better get going
You'd think that by now we'd know how to handle this but we never will
When you are away every day I pray that nothing dies... and you'll
Come back with the same look in your eyes
Funny... always thought of you as my girlfriend
I just can't believe you could come in here and say all those things
Let me finish... you must let me finish
Thank you... thanks for bringing me up to date, dear
Didn't know you knew all the ins and outs of my private life
Let me finish... you must let me finish
Let's talk about you
A minute or two
What tart is your husband keeping?
Where's he sleeping?
Can't you say?
Let's talk about men
You're at it again!
I've heard that you need a bedful
For those dreadful
Games you play
How dare you come in here
Wagging your wicked tongue?
Your cheeks are red, my dear
You look like you've been stung
I know my life's a mess... but I think you're the worst thing in it
Wait a minute...
Let's talk about you
Because you never do
You just couldn't wait to blurt out
All that dirt out in my face
Let's talk about pills
And illegal thrills
I hear that the habit's gripped you
And you've tripped to every place
Does it make you feel good
Knowing that I feel bad?
Yes, knowing you it would
You must be very sad
You can't know how I feel
But my friend you're about to learn how
It's my turn now...
Let's talk about booze
And how much you use
What time do your kids start drinking?
Am I sinking low as you?
Yes, he knows lots of girls... he likes his fun
I am glad he's got lots and not just one
How's that fat little man... was it one more affair?
Where are you going... why are you running away from me?
Are you absolutely sure you don't want to stay for tea?
Don't write a letter when you want to leave
Don't call me at 3 a.m. from a friend's appartment
I'd like to choose how I hear the news
Take me to a park that's covered with trees
Tell me on a Sunday please
Let me down easy, no big song and dance
No long faces, no long looks no deep conversation
I know how I want you to say goodbye
Take me to a zoo that's got chimpanzees
Tell me on a Sunday please
Don't want to know who's to blame
It won't help knowing
Don't want to fight day and night bad enough you're going
Don't leave in silence with no word at all
Don't get drunk and slam the door
That's no way to end this
I know how I want you to say goodbye
Find a circus ring with a flying trapeze
Tell me on a Sunday please
I don't want to fight day and night bad enough you're going
Don't leave in silence with no word at all
Don't get drunk and slam the door
That's no way to end this
I know how I want you to say goodbye
Find a circus ring with a flying trapeze
Tell me on a Sunday please
I'm very you, you're very me
We seem to go well together
You're very me, I'm very you
A perfect match I would say
We mean the world to each other
There are no lengths that we wouldn't go to
Goes to show you...
I'm very you, you're very me
We make a great combination
You're very me, I'm very you
No one could be
More in tune with me
Like sea and sand, like sun and sky
There'll always be you and I
I'm very you, you're very me
We are compatible people
You're very me, I'm very you
I guess we're two of a kind
I stay away when you're moody
If I don't want to talk you make no fuss
We both know us!
I'm very you, you're very me
We're 'bout as close as you can be
You're very me, I'm very you
Sometimes we get
Angry and upset
But each fight ends the way it should
We both make up very good
I'm very you, you're very me
If I was Jane, you'd be Tarzan
You're very me, I'm very you
If I am Bonnie, you're Clyde
If you're New York, then I'm Broadway
If I'm a violin, you're Yehudi
Punch and Judy!
I'm very you, you're very me
We just can't be separated
You're very me, I'm very you
No one has got
What we two have got
Like P and Q, like two and three
You'll always be next to me
Nothing like you've ever known
That's the life I thought that I was gonna show you
Made you choose her love or mine
That's one 'happy ever after' that I owe you
Married man... always looking at your watch
I wanted to spend more time than twelve till two
Loving you... and...
Nothing like we've ever dreamed
I'd have sworn that was the life we would be living
We were both expecting more
And we can't give any more than we are giving
Something new... that is all it was, you know
It would have been better if we stayed as we
Used to be... but
Nothing like you've ever known
That is how I thought all your tomorrows would be
Everyday I look at you
And I stop and think how happy you still could be.
've done it again!... trust me
If you want something ruined, give it to me
Show me a dream and I'll show you a nightmare
I'm not a little girl anymore... I keep forgetting that
Whatever I do now is bound to be a mistake
Maybe I expect too much...
Sit down... there is something I've got to tell you
Don't know how to start... you've been very good but it's just no good
Let me finish, oh please let me finish
It doesn't make sense, us staying together
Yes I know you love me and I love you...
We're friends
That's it, we're friends
Yes I am ungrateful... that's right, always thinking of me
You only act your age if that's the age you want to be
Maybe we should both ignore what I'm saying
Have I said too much?
Yes I think I have
Oh why won't you listen?
Just let me finish... come back!
Let me finish
Come back... can't we sit and talk this thing over?
It's not the end of the world to be free
It's not the end of the world to be me
I guess that's one way to have an arrival, 
first night here out on my ear. 
New York's first lesson they say is survival. 
Well, all right, look at this night. 
First I must get my green card, I don't dare take a chance. 
For if I'm caught working they'll simply deport me, 
and no one will see all the fabulous hats that I make. 
Need one break. 
So much to do in New York when you're single. 
Where to start, ballet or art? 
So much to do in New York with no money; 
thousand pounds, less than it sounds. 
I'm making plans, but I've no place to live. 
It's three A.M. Goodbye Chuck. Hello Viv.
He has got everything, but all he wants is me. 
He loves to hear me talk. How lucky can you be? 
He loves to hear me say, "When does the post arrive?" 
So I keep talking, I just keep talking, 
and he keeps saying he can't live without me. 
English girls get all their own way. 
English girls don't need much to say. 
An accent works wonders, 
that's why English girls do great in L.A. 
(Oh, excuse me....I've got to go to the loo........the loo! 
Oh, yes, from London. We'd love to come to your party!)
He introduces me to all his famous friends. 
They love to hear me talk, the talking never ends. 
He loves to hear me sing "I could have danced all night." 
And it's so easy, it couldn't be more easy, 
and he keeps saying he can't live without me. 
English girls get all their own way. 
English girls know just hat to say. 
An accent works wonders, 
that's why English girls do great in L.A. 
(Oh Mum, you can't imagine! 
In New York I didn't meet anyone from back home, 
but out here they're everywhere! 
There's a whole shop in Santa Monica just packed 
with girls buying English newspapers and digestive bisquits!) 
English girls sound ever so smart. 
English girls have got a head start. 
Joan Collins? I ask you. 
That's why English girls keep milking the part. 
English girls get all their own way. 
English girls are pampered all day. 
He loves me. I feel it, and it's lovely being loved in L.A. 
People must buy hats in L.A. 
I think I just may stay in L.A. 
Capped teeth and Caesar salad.
Blood clot Beverly Hills.
When business starts to dip
wheel out the glucose strip.
Have a cutthroat time
with a twist of lime.
Dreamers trapped in a jewel box.
Big names fading away.
It?s like a wonderland 
except the laughter?s canned.
I?ll call you back and,
have a nice day.
Wonder if I have become a New Yorker. 
N. Y. C. seems home to me. 
Viv says that I'll never be a New Yorker. 
I don't care, I like this air. 
New York's the place to be, funny how things work out, 
a boy from Nebraska that I met in Macy's 
has stopped me from thinking of ev'rything else but his smile. 
That's some smile. 
I never planned that I'd find someone special. 
Somehow he seems right for me. 
Joe is so open and that's why he's special. 
What's inside he doesn't hide. 
Joe's like no Englishman I ever met. 
If I have loved other men I forget.
I have never felt like this
For once I'm lost for words
Your smile has really thrown me
This is not like me at all
I never thought I'd know
The kind of love you've shown me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing
I don't know what is going on
Can't work it out at all
Whatever made you choose me
I just can't believe my eyes
You look at me as though
You couldn't bear to lose me
Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing
I have never felt like this
For once I'm lost for words
Your smile has really thrown me
This is not like me at all
I never thought I'd know
The kind of love you've shown me
Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing
Well, I'm always glad to see you, Viv. 
You must be mistaken, it couldn't have been 
you couldn't have seen him yesterday. 
He's doing some deal down in Baltimore now, 
I hate it when he's away. 
You must be mistaken, I'm sure that you are. 
There's more than one car with stickers on 
and lots of young guys wear corduroy shirts, 
and I'd know if he hadn't gone. 
Take that look off your face. 
I can see through your smile. 
You would love to be right. 
I bet you didn't sleep good last night, 
couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door. 
Well, I've got news for you: I knew before. 
If I'm not mistaken, I know when it came, 
in fact I can name the very day. 
When we started to plan the future and all, 
Joe started to pull away. 
No, I didn't dig deep. 
I did not want to know. 
Well, you don't interfere 
when you're scared of the things you might hear. 
Bet you think I should end this right now as you would do. 
Well, my hard bitten friend, I am not you. 
Take that look off your face! 
I can see through your smile. 
You would love to be right. 
I bet you didn't sleep good last night, 
couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door. 
Well, I've got news for you: I knew before. 
I can see through your smile. 
You would love to be right. 
I bet you didn't sleep good last night, 
couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door. 
Well, I've got news for you: 
I knew before! 
All the signs are showing up now: 
nervous laugh and furtive glance. 
He has left, but can't admit it. 
Now it starts, the song and...
I love New York. I love New York. 
I love the heat. I love the cars, 
the Haagen Dazs, the Sunday Times, 
the phones that work, the single bars, 
the t.v. shows that play all night. 
I love the smells, I love the height, 
I love the banks, I love the crowds. 
Oh! New York, I've never been so lonely. 
Loneliness must be the worst feeling of all. 
What does it take till you feel you belong here, 
till this place shines on your face? 
Viv says new men make her feel she belongs here, 
and she's right, met one last night. 
Paul is the kind of man you might say has it all, 
including a wife and four kids up in West Port. 
But married or not, somehow his eyes kept wand'ring towards me. 
We'll, we'll see. 
What can you do in New York with a green card? 
What a sight! God bless you Dwight. 
No telling what I can do with a green card. 
Watch my speed. Work's what I need. 
Joe may not leave such a void after all, 
with my career, no commitments and Paul.
Skulking around, pretending that I do not know you.
Making sure the looks I throw you, aren?t explicit.
Don?t make a sound, when I meet you where you?re working.
Who?d of thought there?s such fun lurking, in being illicit.
Yes I have met Paul.
How have you been?
How?s um, Shirley?
Meet me in the hall, we mustn?t both leave,early.
There my Super stands with his broom.
He?s closing your clandestine trips to my room.
I don?t care. My affair, is my affair.
West Port Execs, golfing in your Izod V-Necks.
Viv says you?re there like
Kleenex, to be used love.
Desperate for sex. Meeting all those obligations.
Family?s bring such deep
frustrations, oh, my confused love.
Yes I do have thoughts, 
on curing your, dilemma.
When your family ties 
need loosening,
here?s Emma.
I don?t have to love you, you see.
There is one more thing that I get to be,
not alone,
not alone,
not alone...
Mum, this letter is a quick one cuz 
I'm working day and night now. 
If things keep going well 
I'll be the female Calvin Klein. 
Viv's been a smashing friend, Mum, 
introducing me to buyers. 
People find my hats outrageous, 
which in New York means they're fine! 
No, I never hear from Sheldon, 
but I read what he is up to. 
He's working on a musical 
'bout Rommel as a boy. 
Mum, I've never seen a drink here 
that isn't full of ice cubes. 
And I've ever met a waiter here 
who doesn't say "Enjoy." 
I have met this married man, Mum. 
Now don't go off the deep end. 
It's just a bit of nonsense, oh, 
I've made that very clear. 
He's got four lovely children. 
Well, I've only seen their pictures. 
I never really miss him, 
but I like it when he's here. 
I know you won't approve, Mum. 
I feel I must have someone. 
I know if Dad could see me...
Just what time of night do you call this? 
What on earth is wrong? 
Paul, it's half past two, 
you should not be here. 
Let me finish, I said let me finish. 
I have to be up very early tomorrow. 
All right, I can let you stay for a moment. 
You must stop right now. Are you raving mad? 
Don't say one word more. 
Let me finish. I said let me finish. 
You must not even think such things. 
What we have in this room is very sweet, 
but you'd have to be mad to think 
I would want you to leave your wife and kids for me. 
In a way it's almost a joke. 
Do you know what went on with me today? 
I sold my whole collection to Nieman Marcus. 
Today's my best day since I've been here. 
Paul, you have to go home right now. 
Shirley need never find out about this. 
Oh, I see, you've already told her. 
No, I don't deny; 
yes, I said those things, 
but I did not mean... 
Yes, you deserve all the joy that you found here!
This isn't your only chance. 
Oh, Paul, I love you but not in that way. 
Please go. It won't seem so bad in the morning. 
(Listen, we both went into this with our eyes open, 
I never lied to you. I never promised you more. 
We're all grown-ups. Shirley will take you back...in time. 
I'm fond of you Paul, and I'll always be here for you, 
anytime you need.) 
What in the hell have I done this time? 
If you want something ruined, give it to me! 
Show me a dream, and I'll show you a nightmare! 
I'm not a little girl anymore, I keep forgetting that! 
I set out to use Paul, and now look what I have done. 
What kind of a person have I turned into? 
'Cause I never used to be like this. 
A love really hurt me, I hurt someone back. 
My work's had a great successful bow. 
And that look of New York I wanted to have,
oh Emma, I have it now. 
Take that look off your face. 
You were better naive 
what you are always shows on your face 
that's what people believe. 
If you can't face the face in the mirror, who are you? 
It's so simple and yet I never knew! 
I'll be Emma again. 
If it means being hurt, I'll be hurt, 
but I'll like myself then.
Ev'ry word that I'm saying will happen, wait and see. 
If you think that it won't, 
you don't know me,
you don't know me!
