My mind is clearer now
at last all too well.
I can see
where we all
soon will be.
If you strip away
the myth from the man.
You will see
where we all
soon will be.
Jesus
you've started to believe
the things they say of you.
You really do believe
this talk of God is true.
And all the good you've done
will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
than the things you say.
Listen Jesus I don't like what
I see.
All I ask is that
you listen to me.
And remember
I've been your right-hand man
all along.
You have set them all on fire
they think they've found the new
messiah.
And they'll hurt you
when they find they're wrong.
I remember when this
whole thing began
no talk of God then
we called you a man.
And believe me
my admiration for
you hasn't died.
But ev'ry word
you say today
gets twisted 'round
some other way.
And they'll hurt you
if they think you've lied.
Nazareth your famous son
should have stayed
a great unknown.
Like his father carving wood
he'd have made good.
Tables, chairs and oaken chest
would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have cause nobody harm
no one alarm.
Listen Jesus do you
care for your race.
Don't you see
we must keep in our place.
We are occupied
have you forgotten
how put down we are.
I am frightened
by the crowd.
For they are getting
much too loud.
And they'll crush us
if we go too far
if we go too far.
Listen Jesus
to the warning I give.
Please remember that
I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances
weakening with ev'ry hour.
All your followers are blind
too much heaven on their minds.
It was beautiful
but now it's sour
yes it's all gone sour.
Listen Jesus
to the warning I give
please remember that
I want us to live.
So listen, Jesus,
to the warning I give.
Oh, ah, I just want us to live
it's all gone sour.

It seems to me
a strange thing
mystifying.
That a man like you
can waste his time
on women of her kind.
Now I can understand that she
amuses.
But you let her kiss you and
stroke your hair it's hardly in
your line.
It's not that I object
to her profession.
But she doesn't fit in well
with what we teach and say.
It doesn't help us
if you're inconsistent.
Yhey only need a small excuse
to put us all away.
Who are you to criticise her
who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her
let her be now.
Leave her, leave her
she's with me now.
If your slate is clean
then you can throw stones.
If your slate is not
then leave her alone.
I'm amazed that men like you
could be so shallow, thick and
slow.
There is not a man among you
who knows or cares if I come or go.
No you're wrong
you're very wrong.
No you're wrong
you're very wrong.
No you're wrong
you're very wrong.
No you're wrong
you're very wrong.
How can you say that
how can you say that?
How can you say that
how can you say that?
Not one
not one of you.
Try not to get worried
try not to turn on to
problems that upset you.
Oh
don't you know
everything's alright yes
everything's fine.
And we want you to
sleep well tonight.
Let the world
turn without you tonight.
If we try we'll get by
so forget all about us tonight.
Everything's alright yes
everything's alright yes.
Sleep and I shall soothe you
calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead
Oh
then you'll feel
everything's alright yes
everything's fine.
And it's cool
and the ointment's sweet.
For the fire
in your head and feet.
Close your eyes
close your eyes and relax
think of nothing tonight.
Everything's alright yes
everything's alright yes.
Hey, woman your fine ointment
brand new and expensive.
Could have been saved
for the poor.
Why has it been wasted
we could have raised maybe
300 silver pieces
or more.
People who are hungry
people who are starving.
they matter more
than your feet and hair.
Try not to get worried
try not to turn on to.
Problems that upset you
oh
don't you know
everything's alright yes
everything's fine.
And we want you
to sleep well tonight.
Let the world
turn without you tonight.
If we try we'll get by
so forget
all about us tonight.
Everything's alright yes
everything's alright yes.
Surely you're not saying
we have the resources.
To save the poor
from their lot?
There will be poor always
pathetically struggling.
Look at the good things
we've got.
Think while you still have me
move while you still see me.
You'll be lost
you'll be so so sorry
when I'm gone.
Sleep and I shall soothe you
calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead
oh
then you'll feel
everything's alright, yes
everything's fine.
And it's cool
and the ointment's sweet.
For the fire
in your head and feet.
Close your eyes
close your eyes and relax
think of nothing tonight.
Close your eyes close your eyes

Close your eyes close your eyes

Good Caiaphas
the council waits for you.
The pharisees
and priests are here for you.
Ah, gentlemen
you know why we are here.
We've not much time
and quite a problem here.
Hosanna superstar
hosanna superstar.
Hosanna superstar
hosanna superstar.
Listen to that howling mob
of blockheads in the street.
A trick or two with lepers
and the whole town's on its feet.
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
superstar.
He is dangerous
Tell us that you're
who they say you are.
That man is in town right now
to whip up some support.
A rabble rousing mission
that I think we must abort.
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
superstar.
He is dangerous
Look Caiaphas
they're right outside our yard.
Quick Caiaphas
go call the roman guard.
No wait
we need a more permanent solution
to our problem.
What then to do about
Jesus of Nazareth.
Miracle wonder-man
hero of fools.
No riots, no army
no fighting, no slogans.
Infantile sermons
the multitude drools.
We dare not leave him
to his own devices.
His half-witted fans
will get out of control.
But how can we stop him
his glamour increases
by leaps every minute
he's top of the poll.
I see bad things arising
the crowd crown him king
which the romans would ban.
I see blood and destruction
our elimination
because of one man.
Blood and destruction
because of one man.
Because, because
because of one man.
Our elimination
because of one man.
Because, because
because of one
'cause of one
'cause of one man.
What then to do about
this Jesus mania.
How do we deal
with the carpenter king.
Where do we start
with a man who is bigger.
Than John was when John
did his baptism thing.
Fools, you have no perception
the stakes we are gambling
are frighteningly high.
We must crush him completely
so like John before him
this Jesus must die.
For the sake of the nation
this Jesus must die.
Must die, must die
this Jesus must die.
So like John before him
this Jesus must die.
Must die, must die
this Jesus must.
Jesus must
Jesus must die.
Hosanna heysanna
sana sana ho sana

Hey J.C., J.C.
won't you fight for me.
Sanna hosanna
hey superstar.
Tell the rabble to be quiet
we anticipate a riot.
This common crowd
is much too loud.
Tell the mob
who sing your song.
That they are fools
and they are wrong.
They are a curse
they should disperse.
Hosanna heysanna
sanna sanna hosanna
heysanna hosanna.
Hey J.C., J.C.
you're alright by me.
Sanna hosanna
hey superstar.
Why waste your breath
moaning at the crowd.
Nothing can be done
to stop the shouting.
If every tongue was still
the noise would still continue.
The rocks
and stones themselves
would start to sing.
Hosanna heysanna
sanna sanna hosanna
heysanna hosanna.
Hey J.C., J.C.
won't you fight for me.
Sanna hosanna
hey superstar.
Sing me a song
but not for me alone.
Sing out for yourselves
for you are blessed.
There is not one of you
who cannot win the kingdom.
The slow, the suffering
the quick the dead.
Hosanna heysanna ohh
sanna sanna hosanna
heysanna hosanna.
Hey J.C., J.C.
won't you die for me.

I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved.

I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved.
Jesus I am with you
touch me, touch me Jesus.
Jesus I am on your side
kiss me, kiss me Jesus.
Christ what more do you need
to convince you.
That you've made it
and you're easily as strong.
As the filth from Rome
who rape our country.
And who've terrorised
our people for so long.
Christ you know I love you
Did you see I waved
they love you Jesus.
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
ooh yeah.
Christ you know I love you

come on.
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Jesus I am with you
touch me, touch me Jesus.
Jesus I am on your side

There must be over 50,000
screaming love and more
for you.
And every one of 50,000 would do
whatever you asked them to.
But keep them yelling
their devotion
add a touch of hate at Rome.
You will rise
to a greater power.
We will win
ourselves a home.
You'll get the power
and the glory.
You'll get the glory
for ever and ever and ever.
You'll get the power and the glory.
You'll get the power and the glory
forever and ever and ever.
You'll get the power and the glory
forever and ever and ever.
You'll get the glory!!
For you'll get the power and the glory.
And the power
forever and ever and ever.
Forever amen.
Neither you, Simon
nor the 50,000.
Nor the Romans
nor the jews.
Nor Judas, nor the 12,
nor the priests
nor the scribes
nor doomed Jerusalem itself.
Understand what power is
understand what glory is.
Understand at all
understand at all.
If you knew all that I knew
my poor Jerusalem.
You'd see the truth
but you live a lie
but you live a lie.
While you live
your troubles are many
poor Jerusalem.
To conquer death
you only have to die
you only have to die.
I dreamed I met a Galilean
a most amazing man.
He had that look
you very rarely find
the haunting, hunted kind.
I asked him to say
what had happened
how it all began.
I asked again
he never said a word
as if he hadn't heard.
And next the room was full
of wild and angry men.
They seemed to hate this man
they fell on him and then
they disappeared again.
Then I saw
thousands of millions
crying for this man.
And then I heard them
mentioning my name
and leaving me the blame.
Roll on up
for my price is down.
Come on in
for the best in town.
Take your pick
of the finest wine.
Lay your bets
on this bird of mine.
Roll on up
for my price is down.

Borrow cash
on the finest terms.
Hurry now
while stocks still last.
Roll on up Jerusalem
here it isn't us and them.
While our temples still survive
we at least are still alive.
Come all classes, come all creeds
I can fix your wildest needs.
Name your pleasure, I will sell
I got heaven I got hell.
What you see
is what you get.
No one's been
disappointed yet.
Don't be scared
give me a try.
There is nothing
you can't buy.
Roll on up
for my price is down.
Come on in
for the best in town.
Take your pick
of the finest wine.
Lay your bets
on this bird of mine.
Roll on up
for my price is down.
Come on in
for the best in town.
My temple should be
a house of prayer.
But you have made it
into a den of thieves.
Get out get out get out.
My time is almost through
little left to do.
After all
I've tried for three years.
Seems like thirty
seems like thirty.
See my eyes
I can hardly see.
See me stand
I can hardly walk.
I believe
you can make me whole.
See his tongue
he can hardly talk.
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood.
Change my life
oh I know you can.
I believe
you can make me well.
See my purse
I'm a poor, poor man.
Will you touch
will you mend me Christ.
Won't you touch
will you heal me Christ.
Will you kiss
you can cure me Christ.
Won't you kiss
won't you pay me Christ.
See our eyes
we can hardly see.
See us stand
we can hardly walk
We believe
you can make us whole ah.
See the tongues
that can hardly talk ah.
See our skin
we're a mass of blood ah.
Change our lives
oh we know you can ah.
We believe
you can make us whole ah.
You're the hope
of the poor, poor man ah.
Will you touch
will you mend me Christ ah.
Won't you touch
will you heal me Christ ah.
Will you kiss
you can cure me Christ ah.
Won't you kiss
won't you pay me Christ ah.

See me stand, we can hardly walk ah.
There's too too many of you.
I believe you can make us whole ah.
Don't push me
See my tongue that can hardly talk ah.
Oh there's too little of me
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood ah.
See my legs, I can hardly stand ah.
Don't crowd me
We believe you can make us whole ah.
Don't crowd me
See my purse I'm a poor, poor man ah
Don't crowd me
Will you touch

Won't you touch

Won't you kiss
won't you pay me Christ.
Heal yourselves.
Try not to get worried
try not to turn on to.
Problems that upset you
oh.
Don't you know
everything's alright yes
everything's fine.
And I think I shall
sleep well tonight.
Let the world
turn without me tonight.
If we try
we'll get by.
So forget
all about us tonight.
I don't know how to love him
what to do, how to move him.
I've been changed
yes really changed.
In these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man
he's just a man.
And I've had so many
men before.
In very many ways
he's just one more.
Should I bring him down
should I scream and shout.
Should I speak of love
let my feelings out.
I never thought I'd come to this
what's it all about.
Don't you think
it's rather funny.
I should be
in this position.
I'm the one
who's always been.
So calm so cool
no lover's fool.
Running every show
he scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this
what's it all about.
Yet if he said he loved me I'd be lost
I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope
just couldn't cope.
I'd turn my head
I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know
he scares me so.
I want him so
I love him so.
Now if I help you
it matters that you see.
These sordid kind of things
are coming hard to me.
It's taken me some time
to work out what to do.
I weighed the whole thing up
before I came to you.
I have no thought at all
about my own reward.
I really didn't come here
of my own accord.
Just don't
say I'm
damned for all time.
I came because I had to
I'm the one who saw.
Jesus can't control it
like he did before.
And further more I know
that Jesus thinks so too.
Jesus wouldn't mind
that I was here with you.
I have no thought at all
about my own reward.
I really didn't come here
of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm
damned for all time.
Annas, you're a friend
a worldly man and wise.
Caiaphas, my friend
I know you sympathise.
Why are we the prophets
why am I the one.
Who sees the sad solution
know what must be done.
I have no thought at all
about my own reward.
I really didn't come here
of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm
damned for all time.
Cut the protesting
forget the excuses.
We want information
get up off the floor.
We have the papers
we need to arrest him.
You know his movements
we know the law.
Your help in this matter
won't go unrewarded.
We'll pay you in silver
cash on the nail.
We just need to know where the soldiers
can find him.
With no crowd around him
Then we can't fail
I don't want
your blood money.
Oh that doesn't matter
our expenses are good.
I don't need
your blood money.
But you might as well take it
we think that you should.
Think of the things you
could do with the money.
Choose any charity
give to the poor.
We've noted your motives
we've noted your feelings.
This isn't blood money
it's a fee nothing
fee nothing
fee nothing more.
On Thursday night
you'll find him
where you want him.
Far from the crowds
in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Well done Judas
good old Judas.
Well done Judas
good old Judas.
Look at all my trials
and tribulations.
Sinking in a
gentle pool of wine.
Pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers.
'till this evening
is this morning
life is fine.
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would
make it if I tried.
Then when we retire
we can write the gospels.
So they'll still talk
about us when we've died.
The end
is just a little harder
when brought about by friends.
For all you care
this wine could be my blood.
For all you care
this bread could be my body.
The end
this is my blood you drink
this is my body you eat.
If you would remember me
when you eat and drink.
I must be mad thinking
I'll be remembered yes
I must be out of my head.
Look at you blank faces
my name will mean nothing
ten minutes after I'm dead.
One of you denies me
one of you betrays me.
not I.
who would?
Peter will deny me
in just a few hours.
Three times will deny me
and that's not all I see.
One of you here dining
one of my 12 chosen
will leave to betray me.
Cut out the dramatics
you know very well who.
Why don't you go do it.
You want me to do it.
Hurry they are waiting.
If you knew why I do it.
I don't care why you do it.
To think I admired you
for now I despise you.
You liar you Judas
You want me to do it
what if I just stayed here
and ruined your ambition
Christ you deserve it.
Hurry you fool
hurry and go.
Save me your speeches
I don't want to know
go.
Look at all my trials
and tribulations.
Sinking in a
gentle pool of wine.
What's that in the bread
it's gone to my head.
'till this morning
is this evening
life is fine.
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle.
knew that I would
make it if I tried.
Then when we retire
we can write the gospels.
So they'll all talk about us
when we've died.
You sad pathetic man
see where you've brought us to.
Our ideals die around us
all because of you.
the saddest cut of all
someone has to turn you in.
Like a common criminal
like a wounded animal.
A jaded mandarin
a jaded mandarin.
like a jaded, jaded, faded,
jaded mandarin.
Get out, they're waiting
get out.
They're waiting for you.
Every time I look at you
I don't understand.
Why you let the things you did
get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better
if... if you'd had it planned,
oh-oh, oh-oh.
Look at all my trials
and tribulations.
Sinking in a gentle
pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers.
'till this evening
is this morning
life is fine.
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle.
knew that I would
make it if I tried.
Then when we retire
we can write the gospels.
So they'll still talk about us
when we've died.
Will no one stay awake with me
Peter, John, James.
Will none of you wait with me
peter, John, James.
I only want to say
if there is a way.
Take this cup away from me
for I don't want to
taste its poison
feel it burn me.
I have changed
I'm not as sure
as when we started.
Then I was inspired
now I'm sad and tired.
Listen surely
I've exceeded
expectations.
Tried for three years
seems like 30.
Could you ask as much
from any other man.
But if I die
see the saga through.
And do the things
you'd ask of me.
Let them hate me
hit me hurt me
nail me to their tree.
I'd wanna know
I'd wanna know my God.
I'd wanna know
I'd wanna know my God.
I'd wanna see
I'd wanna see my God.
I'd wanna see
I'd wanna see my God.
Why I should die
would I be more noticed
than I ever was before.
Would the things
I've said and done
matter any more.
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord.
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord.
I'd have to see
I'd have to see my Lord.
I'd have to see
I'd have to see my Lord.
If I die
what will be my reward.
If I die
what would be my reward.
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord.
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord.
Why should I die
oh-oh.
why should I die.
Can you show me now
that I would not be
killed in vain.
Show me just a little
of your omnipresent brain.
Show me there's a reason
for you wanting me to die.
You're far to keen
on where and how
and not so hot on why.
Alright I'll die
just watch me die.
See how I die
see how I die.
oh, watch me die.
Oh, oh
watch me die.
Then I was inspired
now I'm sad and tired.
After all
I've tried for three years
seems like 90.
Why then am I
scared to finish
what I started.
What you started
I didn't start it.
God thy will be done
destroy your only son.
I will drink
your cup of poison.
Nail me to your
cross and break me.
Bleed me beat me
kill me take me.
Now before I change my mind
now before I change my mind.
There he is
they're all asleep
the fools.
Judas must you betray me
with a kiss.
What the buzz
tell me what's a happening?

somewhere
I remember.
You were with that man
they took away
I recognise your face.
You've got the wrong man lady
I don't know him.
And I wasn't where
he was tonight
never near the place.
That's strange for I am sure
I saw you with him.
You were right by his side
and yet you denied.
I tell you
I was never ever with him.
But I saw you too
it looked just like you.
I don't know him!
Peter don't you know
what you have said.
You've gone and
cut him dead.
I had to do it
don't you see
or else they'd go for me.
It's what he told us
you would do
I wonder how he knew.
Who is this broken man
cluttering up my hallway
who is this unfortunate.
Someone Christ
king of the jews.
Oh, so this is Jesus Christ
I am really quite surprised.
You look so small
not a king at all.
We all know that you are news
but are you king
king of the jews.
That's what you say I am
Oh, what do you mean by that
that is not an answer.
You're deep, deep in trouble friend
someone Christ
King of the jews.
How can someone
in your state
be so cool about his fate.
An amazing thing
this silent king.
Since you come from Galilee
then you need not come to me.
You're Herod's race
he's Herod's case.
Hosanna heysanna
sanna sanna hosanna
heysanna ho and how.
Hey J.C., J.C.
please explain to me.
You had everything
where is it now.
Jesus I am overjoyed
to meet you face to face.
You've been getting
quite a name
all around this place.
Healing cripples
raising the dead.
And now I understand you're

at least that's what you've said.
So you are the Christ

That's all you need do
and I'll know it's all true
come on you king of the jews.
Jesus you just won't believe
the hit you've made
'round here.
you're all we ever talk about.
you're the wonder of the year.
Oh what a pity
if it is all a lie.
Still I'm sure
that you can rock
the cynics if you try.
So you are the Christ
yes, the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me
that you're no fool
walk across my swimming pool.
If you do that for me
and I'll let you go free.
come on you king of the jews.
hello, Jerusalem.
I am your king!
I only ask what I'd ask of any
superstar.
What is it that you have got
that puts you where you are.
Oh, I am waiting
yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown
that you are not just any man.
So if you are the Christ
the great Jesus Christ.
Feed my household with this bread
you could do it on your head.
Or has something gone wrong
why do you take so long
come on you king of the jews.
hey... aren't... you

king of the...
Get out you
king of the jews.

I've been living to see you
dying to see you
but it shouldn't be like this.
This was unexpected
what do I do now.
Could we start again please.
Could we start again please.
I've been very hopeful so far
now for the first time
I think we're going wrong.
Hurry up and tell me
this is all a dream.
Or could we start again please.
Could we start again please.
I think you've made
your point now.
You've even gone a bit too far
to get your message home.
Before it gets too frightening
we ought to call a halt.
Oh, could we
start again please.

My God
I saw him
he looked three quarters dead.
And he was so bad
I had to turn my head.
You beat him so hard
that he was bent and lame.
And I know who everybody's
gonna blame.
I don't believe he knows
I acted for our good.
I'd save him all the
suffering if I could.
Don't believe
our good.
and I'd save him if I could.
Cut the confessions
forget the excuses.
I don't understand
why you're filled with remorse.
All that you've said
has come true
with a vengeance.
The mob turned against him
you backed the right horse.
What you have done
will be the saving of Israel.
You'll be remembered
forever for this.
And not only that
you've been paid
for your efforts.
Pretty good wages
for one little kiss.
Christ
I know you can't hear me.
But I only did
what you wanted me to.
Christ
I'd sell out the nation.
For I have been saddled
with the murder of you.
I have been spattered
with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged
through the slime and the mud.
I have been spattered
with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged
though the slime and the slime
and the slime and the mud.
... I don't know how to love him.
I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man
he's just a man
he is not a king.
he is just the same
as anyone I know
he scares me so.
When he's cold and dead
will he let me be.
Does he love
does he love me too
does he care for me.
My mind is in darkness now
my God I am sick.
I... I have been used!
and you knew all the time.
God, I'll never know why you
chose me for your crime.
your foul bloody crime.
You have murdered me
you have murdered me.
Murdered me
murdered me
murdered me.
Murdered me!
Murdered me, murdered me.
Murdered me!
Murdered me, murdered me!
Murdered me!
Poor old Judas
so long Judas.
Poor old Judas
so long Judas.
And so the king
is once again my guest.
And why is this
was Herod unimpressed.
We turn to Rome
to sentence Nazareth.
We have no law
to put a man to death.
We need him crucified
it's all you have to do.
We need him crucified
it's all you have to do.
Talk to me Jesus Christ
you have been brought here.
Manacled beaten
by your own people.
Do you have the first idea
why you deserve it.
Listen king of the jews
where is your kingdom
look at me, am I a jew.
I have got no kingdom
in this world
I'm through, through, through.
Talk to me Jesus Christ
There may be
a kingdom for me somewhere
if I only knew.
Then you're a king
It's you that say I am
I look for truth
and find that I get damned.
But what is truth
not easy to define.
We both have truths
are yours the same as mine.
Crucify him
crucify him.
What do you mean
you'd crucify your king.
We have no king but Caesar
He's done no wrong
no not the slightest thing.
We have no king but Caesar
crucify him.
Well this is new
respect for Caesar.
Till now this has been
noticeably lacking.
Who is this Jesus
why is he different.
You jews produce messiahs
like a sackful.
We need him crucified
it's all you have to do.
We need him crucified
it's all you have to do.
Talk to me Jesus Christ
Look at your Jesus Christ
I'll agree he's mad
ought to be locked up.
But that is not a reason
to destroy him.
He's a sad little man
not a king or god.
Not a thief
I need a crime.
kill him he says he's god
he's a blasphemer.
He'll conquer you and us
and even caesar.
Crucify him
crucify him.
Behold the man
behold your shattered king.
We have no king but Caesar
You hypocrites
you hate us more than him.
We have no king but Caesar
crucify him.
I find no reason
I see no evil.
This man is harmless
so why does he upset you.
He's just misguided
thinks he's important.
But to keep you vultures happy
I shall flog him.
Crucify him
crucify him.
Crucify, crucify
crucify, crucify.
Crucify him
crucify him.
Crucify, crucify
crucify, crucify.

Where are you from Jesus
what do you want Jesus
tell me.
You've got to be careful
you could be dead soon
could well be.
Why do you not speak
when I have your life
in my hands.
How can you stay quiet
I don't believe
you understand.
You have nothing
in your hands
any power you have
comes to you from far beyond.
Everything is fixed
and you can't change it.
You're a fool Jesus Christ
how can I help you.
Pilate crucify him

Don't let me stop
your great self-destruction.
Die if you want to
you misguided martyr.
I wash my hands
of your demolition.
Die if you want to
you innocent puppet.
Every time I look at you
I don't understand.
Why you let the things you did
get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better
if you'd had it planned.
Why'd you choose
such a backward time
and such a strange land.
If you'd come today
you would have reached
a whole nation.
Israel in 4 B.C. had no
mass communication.

Buddha was he where it's at

Could Mohammed move a mountain
or was that just P.R.
Did you mean to die like that

Or did you know
your messy death
would be a record breaker.
