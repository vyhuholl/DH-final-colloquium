
            Prologue       
            (A railway cutting. A wild stormy summer night. The Signal Man is in his signalbox.
He receives a message from down the line. He wires back a message.
We hear the strange,eerie singing of the wires.
From the gloom we see a figure of a man-Walter Hartright.
He is about 30 years of age,attractive,dark,open.
He carries a bag and an easel.
He sees the Signal Man checking the tracks with his lantern below him)

HARTRIGHT:Hallo! Below there! Hallo!
(A lightning flash)
HARTRIGHT:Signal Man? Down there...Hallo!
(Pause)
SIGNAL MAN:Who calls to me in the dead of the night?
(Walter steps out of the shadows into the light of the Signal Man's lantern)
HARTRIGHT:Hartright. My name is Walter Hartright.
(He climbs down to the Signal Man's level)
SIGNAL MAN:What are you doing here, on a night like this?
HARTRIGHT:I'm lost sir. I'm trying to find my way to Limm'ridge
House-The train broke down and I'm forced to walk.
SIGNAL MAN:Branch train broke down-what you say is true.
HARTRIGHT:Yes,I heard the wires singing in the wind-The noise of them led me to you.
SIGNAL MAN:Why are you going to Limm'ridge House?
HARTRIGHT:I have the post of drawing master-I must arrive tonight for I start tomorrow...
Sir, you look upon me with such dread.
(Pause)
SIGNAL MAN:Last night I had a vision
That a stranger would appear
He stood right where you are-
A man such as yourself.
"Alarm on the line!" he said
Alarm on the line!
So I tapped out the message
And the answer came back
"All well both ways
But he said "You'll mark my words
When a year to this day
The dead lie on the tracks!
The dead lie on the tracks!
HARTRIGHT:I can assure you sir,I know of no imminent danger!
SIGNAL MAN:A man such as yourself!
(Suddenly there is a strange sound in the air. The telegraph wires sound again in the signal box)
SIGNAL MAN:There calling me from the down the line. There's danger somewhere along the line.
(The sound of the wires grows to a terrible pitch.
From behind Hartright,from the depths of the tunnel a hand reaches out and touches him on the shoulder.
It is a woman dressed in white(Anne Catherick).
She is in her early 20's,fair,attractive,but her face is drawn and sorrowful.
Her manner is wild and insistent)
HARTRIGHT:(startled)Oh, my God!
ANNE:You've got to help me!
There's someone after me!
HARTRIGHT:How can I help you?
ANNE:I'm being followed and I've done nothing wrong!
HARTRIGHT:It's very late for you to be out here alone-
ANNE:You must believe me that I am free from blame.
HARTRIGHT:Who do you run from?
ANNE:I dare not say his name!
HARTRIGHT:Where do you live?
I'll try to help you if I can.
ANNE:I have a secret.
My precious secret
But can I trust you?
But can I trust you?
(Her tone changes. She reaches out to him.)
ANNE:They cannot take away my secret-
thought it's something I can't share with you.
It's locked inside my heart,my secret-
but there's someone I must tell it to.
Secrets kept inside can hurt you
mine is sharper than a knife
If I tell the one I seek
I may save her life.
(She is in distress)
HARTRIGHT:Please you needn't fear me
truly you can trust me
I would never harm you
I'm no threat-I am Walter...
Walter Hartright. I'll help you to get home.
ANNE:I've no home at all
nothing but my secret I have just my secret.
(Hartright reaches out and gently takes her hand.
The noise of a pony and chaise approaching. She breaks away)
ANNE:There's someone coming!
And I must get away-
I have to get away!
But can I trust you?
(She moves off toward the tunnel)
HARTRIGHT:Don't go in there!
He said there's danger on the line
ANNE:(echoing)I'll tell my secret for secrets must be told
(She disappears back into the tunnel. A servant enters)
SERVANT:You must be Mister Hartright?
HARTRIGHT:Yes
SERVANT:I'm sent to bring you straight to Limm'ridge House.
HARTRIGHT:Did you see her?
A woman,dressed in white.
SERVANT:I saw no one
HARTRIGHT:A woman all in white?
SERVANT:Sir,I saw no one
I saw no one.
(The servant picks up Hartright's bags and exits with them.
Hartright looks around and then exits after him.
The light is beginning to dawn on a new day)

            Parlour games
(limmeridge house. The morning room-light and summery.
Marian halcombe is there. She is in her 30's-dark,vivacious,
And attractive although not conventionally pretty.
Hartright enters,tired after the night's exertions. Marian shakes his hand)

Hartright:you must be miss halcombe-i'm so sorry-
Marian:(interrupting him)
Thank god you have arrived
You're fated to become
My drawing teacher
You poor poor creature
Our village is as dull
As it may first appear
A city mouse in limm'ridge house
I hope you'll like it here

You're less than half the age
That we thought you might be
You'll feed our hunger
For someone younger
So please unpack your bags
And please be of good cheer
I'm sure you'll like where you reside
But with respect i must confide,
I can't abide the countryside
I hope you'll like it here

You shall be the drawing master
To my sister and to me
Though she learns a little faster
A disaster i will be
We're the product of one mother
But we come from diff'rent fathers
I think mine,for design,
Was completely talent free

Very soon you'll meet my sister
Well,she's tech'nic'ly my half
But she's my whole world-my sister
Is the wheat and i'm the chaff
She's kind and generous and fun
Much younger, and the pretty one!

My father was quite poor
Her father's wealth was vast
So she'll inherit and gladly share it
We're close as two can get
Between us not one tear
Perpetually in harmony
I hope you'll like it here

Pretty soon you'll meet my uncle
Whose prognosis is quite grim
He will tell you that his chances
Of recovery are slim
With his bed pan and his hanky
He is terminally cranky
Though no doctor around
Found a thing that's wrong with him

But how i do go on
I try to keep it short
Then lose the battle and simply prattle
But getting to the point
My welcome is sincere
We're thrilled that's indisputable
I hope your rooms are suitable
Your sentence is commutable
I hope you'll like it here

A servant arrives and escorts hartright to mr fairlie's dark study

(mr fairlie sits beside a portrait of hsi brother-philip fairlie.
Mr fairlie is in his fifties but looks older,he is frail,morose,pale,crabby,wheelchair-bound)

Servant:mr walter hartright
Hartright:mr fairlie!
(mr fairlie looks hartright up and down)
Mr fairlie:you're than i thought
The young are mostly fools
The good time ceases when with my nieces
Just go about your task
And try to disappear
(to the servant)
Don't lurk about you oafish lout
(to hartright)i trust you'll like it here
(he gestures to the portrait)
That's a portrait of my brother...
Was the picture of good health...
Now he's dead and i am dying...
While i'm living...on his wealth
Up until he left for hades
He was catnip to the ladies....
But at least the deceased had a modicum of stealth
Well enough about my fam'ly
(to servant)would you please adjust my chair?
(to hartright)i should send you back to ripen
Like a proper camembert
Thought i should find some other chap
I'd much prefer to take a nap
(to servant who reappears)
I told you to get out!
I simply can't go on
My nerves are fraying...
What was i saying?
Oh,mostly i desire
A quiet atmosphere
As silent as a sepulchre
No utterance above a purr
Just nod your head
If you concur
I trust you'll like it here.

            Perspective       
            (The conservatory. Marian enters)

Marian:
Is she not the way that I described her?
We're as unalike as black and white

Laura:
Still we are insep'rable

Marian:
Joined as day to night,
Very clearly of a diff'rent feather-
We're an odd but merry pair of birds!
She'd say I'm verbose and garrulous-

Laura:
But in fewer words!

Marian:
Laura!

Laura (to Hartright):
I fear your journey here was tedious?

Hartright:
My journey was filled with drama!
First I met the local Signal Man- a strange and
Unearthly man. He told me he'd had a vision that I
Would come and that I would bring tragedy in my wake.

Laura:
Heavens!

Hartright:
Indeed!
But he said: ?You'll mark my words!
When a year to this day
The dead lie on the tracks!
The dead lie on the tracks!?

Marian:
How strange!

Hartright:
What happened next was stranger still
A woman breathless and afraid
Appeared out of the night!
Completely dressed in white
She had a secret she would tell
Of one who had mistreated her.
Her face and frightened gaze
My mind cannot erase?
But then she ran from view.
(to Laura) She looked so much like you.

Laura:
Perhaps you saw a ghost?

Hartright:
Ghost or not, she haunts me still.
She looked so much like you?
Marian:
We must clear up this mystery!

Hartright:
But first, ladies, we must take
Advantage of this wonderful light!

(A beautiful summer's day for their first drawing lesson.
They are outside in the formal gardens of Limmeridge House with a couple of servants, all three
before their easels, drawing. We hear both what they express openly and their inner thoughts)

Marian:
Nothing's duller than my watercoloring
I've next to no technique at all

Laura:
My pen and ink are passable

Marian:
My pen and ink appall.
All my sketching soon will have you retching.
I'm a notch below a chimpanzee.

Laura:
But we're highly trainable.

Marian:
We shall wait and see.

Hartright:
You can capture shade and light
Best of all perspective

Marian: All I ever do is tright

Hartright:
Beauty is subjective
You'll develop your own style

Marian:
He has such a winning smile

Hartright:
You will know when it feels right

Laura:
I could trust him at first sight

Hartright:
Be observant, be a humble servant
Solely dedicated to your art

Laura:
I can hardly concentrate

Marian:
What a shaky start.

Hartright:
Don't conceal the things you think and feel
Get your emotion flowing through your brush

Marian:
If I follow your advice
You would surely blush

Laura:
If I practiced what you preach
I'd be more effective

Hartright (gazing at Laura):
She's so clearly out of reach
Seen from my perspective

Marian:
He's a breath of summer air

Hartright:
See the sunlight in her hair

Laura:
I must disregard his charms

Laura and Marian:
And his manly rugged arms

Marian:
Give me people not a tree or steeple
Not a slice of apple and a knife
Still life's not as int'resting
As a slice of life

Hartright (looking at Marian's drawing):
You're improving, this is very moving,
That's a cocker spaniel clear and true.

Marian:
Thank you for the compliment
I was sketching you!

All Three:
What's the reason I am here?
What is my objective?
What a stirring atmosphere!
But where is my perspective?

Can you get a dizzy thrill?
While the world is standing still?
Yet the summer's drifting by
While these golden moments fly.

            Trying Not to Notice       
            (We are now in wilder couldtryside. It is hot.
Collars are undone, shawls are abandoned.
Hartright starts to sketch laura)


Marian

Sweet tension fills the air
Which i know i ought not dwell upon
I look away and still see him there
I'm trying not to notice him
Yet i can't help but stare

Hartright

No gazing!
Know your place
Words that i'd be wise to tell myself!
I close my eyes and i still see her face
I'm trying not to notice her
But i don't stand a chance

Laura

I'm trying not to notice him
Yet i return each glance
A thousand contradictions
Are stirring in my soul
They seem to grow in me
Overflow in me

Hartright

In spite of my convictions
I'm losing my control

Marian

I'm slightly shocked inside
Keep it locked inside

All three

Unspoken
Unexpressed
Still it's louder than a symphony
Can no one hear what my heart seems to shout?
Perhaps they do not notice it
Though it's as plain as day
I'm trying not to notice it
But it won't go away

(the end of the lesson... Marian and laura gather up their brushes and paints.
They go to exit-laura realizes that she has forgotten something.
She returns to where hartright is. They both linger for a moment)

            I Believe My Heart       
            Hartright

Whenever i look at you
The world disappears
All in a single glance so revealing
You smile and i feel as though
I've known you for years
How do i know to trust what i'm feeling?

I believe my heart
What else can i do
When ev'ry part of ev'ry thought
Leads me straight to you

I believe my heart
There's no other choice
For now whenever
My heart speaks
I can only hear your voice

Laura

The lifetime before we met
Has faded away
How did i live a moment without you?
You don't have to speak at all
I know what you'd say
And i know every secret about you

I believe my heart
It believes in you
It's teling me
That what i see
Is completely true
I believe my heart
How can it be wrong
It says that what i feel for you
I will feel my whole life long

Both

I believe my heart
And it believes in you
It's telling me
That what i see
Is completely true

And with all my soul
I belive my heart
The portrait that it paints of you
Is a perfect work of art

(he takes the sketch that he has made of her and gives it to her)

Hartright

I'm afraid it doesn't do you justice

            You See I Am No Ghost       
            Marian Tells of the Engagement

(The formal gardens, Limmeridge House.
Morning. An autumnal feel.
The first leaves dropping from the trees.
A servant escorts Hartright to Marian.
Hartright enters)

Anne: Walter Hartright. I remember you.

Walter: are you of this world? Have i imagined you?

Anne: You see i am no ghost before you
I am flesh and blood believe your eyes
Kind sir, my name is anne,  Anne Catherick
and believe my words, i tell no lies
Limmeridge was my home in child hood, though i didnt live here long
locked away while still a girl although i did nothing wrong
imprisoned in a dark Asylum by a man of guile and treachery
a triple theif of lives, i vow it
though he thinks that he can silence me, i told you that i had a secret, one i cannot share with you
i must find the one i seek to spare her what i've been through!
Ill tell you of my cruel tormenter!
when i think of him, im filled with shame
ill tell you who he is this instant if you swear you wont forget his name

Walter: I swear

Anne: Sir Percival Glyde. Sir Percival Glyde

Walter: Sir Percival Glyde. (she runs) No please wait!

Marian: Mr. Hartright, there's a very private matter we must speak of right away-

Hartright: Pay it isn't serious?

Marian: This is hard for me to say.
In the days before you came here you were out of money out of spirits then?

Hartright: I was down but rarely out of spirits.
You'd have found me in a Holborn drinking den.

Marian: Then it's safe to say you value your position?

Hartright: More than anything at all.

Marian: Since we both were children
Laura sometimes sleepwalks
I would wake and find her
On the stair unaware of how she got there
More than her half sister
I am her whole family
And I must protect her.

Hartright: What reason do you tell me this?

Marian: I know, sir, what your secret is.

Hartright: I have no secrets here.

Marian: My sister is engaged!
To a man of sterling character
A titled man of property-
A man her father chose.

Hartright: What?

Marian: It was my duty to tell you this.

Hartright: (shocked) Then Laura will marry another?

Marian: You must crush all feelings for her.
There can be no hope of any attachment.
No hope of any future... I'm sorry if this hurts you.

Hartright: Are you sorry, Miss Halcomb?

Marian: What do you mean?

Hartright: (pointedly at her) Perhaps I"m not the only one with secrets.
Feelings that I'd rather hide.

Marian: You are most unkind. You should go, you've said enough.
I'm doing this to help you, to save you from yourself.

(He goes to go, stops, turns)

Hartright: I'd like to know his name.

Marian: His name is not your business.

Hartright: (impassioned) Please let me know his name.

Marian: His name is Glyde. Sir Percival Glyde.


Sir Percival Glyde Arrives

(The next day. Mr. Fairlie's study.
Laura and Marian wait with their uncle.
A servant announces Sir Percival Glyde's arrival)

Servant: Sir Percival Glyde.

(Glyde is a handsome, aristocratic, elegant man in his early to middle thirties.
His manner is easy and charming)

Glyde: With all my heart
I'm glad to be here

Mr. Fairlie: Sir Percival Glyde
Here in this house
You're always welcome

Glyde: (to Fairlie) The picture of health!
I've never seen you look so well sir.

Mr. Fairlie: Is he talking to me?

Glyde: You're such a hale and a hearty fellow.

Marian: You, sir, it's true, are a tonic.
It does us good to see you.

Glyde: Thank you my friend, and me-you.
But Laura my dear
Second to non you're the one I miss most
It's perfectly clear
With all my heart
I need you
Which brings me to my purpose
Why must we wait till spring?

Laura: What?

Glyde: Let's have a Christmas wedding
And the joy that it would bring us
(to Laura) My home and heart are ready
So now it's up to you.

(A pause)

Laura: It was my father's dying wish and I will do as I have promised to.

Glyde: In all of this world
There's not a man as thrilled as I am
Or lucky as I.
No on this earth is a man more joyful.

Marian and Mr. Fairlie: Sir Percival Glyde!
Good luck to you and your bride.

Glyde: My dearest friend Count Fosco
Shall act as our best man
You'll see he has no better
When you meet tonight
and there's no better plan!

Marian: Sir Percival Glyde!

Glyde: (to Marian) You from this day shall be my sister.

Marian: With pleasure and pride!

Glyde: And we shall see that our home is your home.

Mr. Fairlie: There's nothing to decide.
My niece will marry Glyde.
A Christmas wedding
Is where we're heading
And Marian will go
And live with them, no fear
The instant she becomes his spouse
They both will exit Limm'ridge House
Which will be quiet as a mouse
At last I'll like it here!


Fosco Arrives

(Later the same day Count Fosco arrives at Limmeridge House.
He is a big bear of a man - in his fifties, with an Italian accent.
He is impeccably dressed.
His luggage includes various bird and animal cages.
He pulls a mouse seeminly out of the air and addresses it.)

Fosco: Well my friend at least we have arrived
It seems that I was born to be a house guest
You might choose this moment to get out of sight
For now, they need not know they have a mouse guest.

(He kisses the mouse and then places it in his pocket. Marian arrives to greet him)

Fosco: I am please to meet the blushing bride.

Marian: Actually, I'm just the blushing bridesmaid.

Fosco: Pardon me it's just that you're so beautiful
Which is why I thought you might be Glyde's maid.

Marian: There's no mistaking you're Count Fosco!

Fosco: I've a reputation that proceeds me?

Marian: I am Laura's sister sent to welcome you.

Fosco: (kissing her hand) May I nibble on the hand that feeds me?

Marian: You may dine on any single you wish
Though I'd wait for dinner we are serving fish.

Fosco: There's no time to sate my many appetites.

Marian: You might consider taking smaller bites.

Fosco: It's so very kind of you to have me here.

Marian: You, sir, add some interest to the atmosphere

Fosco: I detect a fire beneath your prim veneer

(A dinner bell rings)

Marian: I regret there's not more time to tarry

Fosco: But I presume that we'll resume this thrust and parry!

(He smiles at her, winks. She shows him in. Servants arrive and remove his luggage)


The Evening That Goes Wrong

(After dinner the same evening.
The drawing room. Laura is playing the piano,
with Sir Percival Glyde sitting close to her.
Marian, Mr. Fairlie, Fosco, and
Walter Hartright are looking on.
Hartright sits on his own in a corner of the room.
Laura finishes playing and there is enthusiastic applause led by Fosco)

Fosco: Bravissima, my dear! You play like an angel.

Laura: I play only moderately well.

Fosco: My dear, don't hide your light!
If you have talents, you must flaunt them!

Marian: Pray sir, what are your talents?
Perhaps I could persuade you to come out from under your bushel?

            Gift for Living Well       
            Fosco:  No, no, no! Well, if you insist.

Fosco:  I am a man
Of medicine
No opera star,
(with passion) My voice is thin
Though I play cards
And violin
At none of these do I excel.

The talent that
I have in spades
Is one for fun
And escapades
A gift for living well
Attracted to the lively arts
Breaking bread, breaking hearts.

(He looks at Marian)

Making love, when love has me spellbound.

(He takes some wine from a servant, fills his glass)

Italian food
The wines of France
I never walk when I can dance

(A small pirouhette for the ladies)

A gift for living well

A one man band
I sing the lead
Alwasy self-accompanied

(He plays a few chords on the piano)

I concede probably I'm hellbound

A bon vivant
As you can see
A lust for life as big as me!
A gift for living well.

Fosco: But enough about me! Raise your glasses

(Fosco raises his glass to the bride and groom)

Fosco: Sir Percival Glyde!

All: (raising their glasses) Oh what a joyous occasion this is!
Sir Percival Glyde!

Fosco: Dolce vita to you and your Mrs.!

Glyde: This is the moment I've longed for.

Marian: Everything's for the best now.

Mr. Fairlie:  I'll have an empty nest now.

All: And here's to the bride!
Cheers for the life they will lead from now...

(Hartright suddenly interrupts the toast - addresses Sir Percival Glyde)

Hartright:  Please let me speak
And forgive my interruption
Please hear me out
On a very pressing matter
One that concerns a girl
Her name is Anne, Anne Cath'rick
She says you've done her wrong
Have you an explanation?

Mr. Fairlie: What impertinence! Mr. Hartright, know your place sir!

Glyde: No, no, Mr. Fairlie, I am glad that he asked this. Please, please.
I am happy to clear up the matter of Anne Catherick...

Glyde: Her tale is truly sorrowful
And some would say a tragedy
Her story breaks my heart
I don't know where to start
Her mother was in my employ
(to Mr. Fairlie) Your brother recommended her
Recall, she worked here too?

Mr. Fairlie: Catherick? I'm not sure that I do.

Glyde: Anne was so sweet as an infant
She used to laugh all the time
She sparkled like the sun
Such a pretty one
Yet she grew up so unhappy
Sullen and angry and sad
She was a troubled child
Acting strange and wild
She once attacked her mother
When she was just sixteen
A fury with no pause
No one knew the cause
To help her grieving mother
And rescue Anne herself
I undertook her care
I tried to see her through
It was the Christian thing to do

When no physician could treat her
I found a haven that would
A trusted private place
To embrace her case
Anne thinks of me as her captor
When I am truly her friend
For all her care I pay
Still she runs away.

(Fosco who appears moved by the story shakes Glyde by the hand)

Fosco: I'm touched by your compassion
Your kindness knows no bounds.

Glyde: I've done the best I can
I've done my best for Anne.

(Once again Hartright speaks up)

Hartright: She spoke sir of a secret
A secret she would tell.

Glyde: Her world has come to be utter fantasy
But her safe return
Is my great concern
And I am grateful for
Your help.

Laura: Poor Anne.
Her story saddens me.

Marian: Yet it explains the mystery.

Fosco: Had it not been for Glyde
I'm sure she would have died.

Mr. Fairlie: No more please!
Neither Anne Catherick nor her silly mother are any of your business, sir.
And once more, my nerves are quite shot.

Fosco: Then a shot of brandy is what I prescribe, Signor!

Mr. Fairlie: Yes, let us retire at once to my study, gentlemen.

(Glyde, Fosco, and Mr. Fairlie leave.  Glyde bows his thanks again to Hartright)

Glyde: Thank you, sir.

(Hartright is left with the two women)

Hartright: I don't believe him
Can't you see he's clearly lying
As for your uncle
It's the truth that he's denying.

Marian: Sir, you must leave at once.
You must go right away.

Laura: But, Marian-

Marian: What reason has he to lie?
How can you hope to stay here?

Laura: Please Marian-

Marian:  Laura our future is settled
Soon you'll be Lady Glyde
You'll have a perfect life
As that fine man's wife
He is a man of compassion
Look how he helped that poor girl
He has integrity
He's all a man should be!

(Laura looks to Hartright)

Hartright: I clearly don't belong here
Your sister is quite right
I leave for London now!

(Laura runs out, upset)

Hartright: (to Marian) Are you happy now?

(He exits.  Marian left alone crumples, begins to cry)

Marian: I close my eyes and I still see his face.

(She exits)


The Tryst

(Hartright is there with his bags and easel, departing.
Laura enters in haste, wearing a white nightdress)

Laura: Tell me this isn't happening.  Tell me I'm walking in my sleep.

Hartright: I'm sorry.

Laura: I believe my heart
It believes in you

Laura and Hartright: Ev'ry part of ev'ry thought leads me straight to you.

(She gives him the sketch that he gave to her in the drawing lesson)

Laura: Take this...something to remember me by.

(He leaves)

            Holly and the Ivy       
            CHORUS

The Holly and the Ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The Holly bears the crown
The holly bears a berry
As red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good

The holly bears a prickle
As sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas Day in the morn
The holly bears a bark
As bitter as any gaul
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
For to redeem us all




The Holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The holly bears the crown
Oh the rising of the sun
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry women
Sweet sleeping in the cloud


Forever husband and wife
Dance of your life
Merrily Merrily
She is a source of pride in his arms
Pride in his arms
Merrily Merrily

Time for Rejoice and Time for Bliss
Dance to the bridge and groom!
Cheers to the Bride and Groom!
Here's to the Bride and Groom!



Lady Laura Glyde
Lady Laura Glyde
The church bells are ringing
They call out to warn you
But even my warnings were too late to save you
Now your fate is sealed
How can he be stopped?
You'll be the lady of Black Water House
All the rooms filled with sorrow
The lake filled with tear drops
Where you're at his mercy and he knows no mercy
I can't let this come to pass
I can't let you suffer as I did
I must journey to your side
So, unlike me,
You won't be friendless
So, unlike me, you won't be friendless


Welcome to your new home Lady Glyde!
Laura what is it?
Laura!
Something is wrong!


She is just tired


No I Must go to her!


Oh she will calm down
You live in her shadow!


If I do
Then It is because I am comfortable there


She is lovely
But you Miss Halcombe
Are beyond All compare


Leave me alone
I don't need your help!


Laura you know you can trust me
Please let me know what is wrong
We seem so far apart and it breaks my heart!


Trust you? Now why should I trust you?
When your advice led me here
Straight from the wedding prayer to complete despair!
He only wants my money!
That's all he wants from me!
Though he's a barronet
He is steep in debt
I'll show you how he loves me!
I think you'd want to see
His love is on display
A mark for every day'
You said he's all a man should be!

            The Document       
            Laura:
You wanted me?

Glyde:
I have a document for you to sign

Laura:
A document?

Glyde:
Sit here, use my pen.

Laura:
A document, what kind of document?

Glyde:
Just sign it here, and here, and we'll be done

Laura:
Now?

Glyde:
It's a formality
Sign your name Lady Glyde
Here, on the line.

Laura:
What are you asking me to sign?

(Fosco enters, all civility)

Fosco:
Percival, you said you needed me
I am at your service
Ah, Buongiorno, ladies
I trust you slept well?

Glyde:
I need a witness to Laura's signature

Laura:
Again, what is this document?

Glyde:
Sign your name Lady Glyde

Marian:
Sir! She has a right to know

Glyde:
It pertains, Miss Halcombe,
To a man and his wife

Laura:
Then let me read it first
That isn't asking much

Glyde:
Sign, I have a carriage waiting!

Marian (to Count Fosco):
Do you know what's in these papers?

Fosco:
I'm as ignorant as you and Lady Glyde

Glyde:
Sign!

Laura:
But I cannot sign
What I haven't read

Glyde:
It is too involved
For your pretty head
As a sign of trust
Please pick up the pen

Laura:
I will read it first
I will trust you then

Marian:
Let our lawyer bless
What you want from her
And she'll acquiesce
With her signature

Glyde:
You've a pointed tone
That I will not bear

Marian:
That's a point of view
I completely share

Glyde:
Sign your name Lady Glyde
Infernal women,
You know nothing about business!

Fosco:
Calmly my dear friend
Lady Glyde's upset
So is her sister
Can't the papers wait another day?

Glyde:
This is a timely matter
And it will not wait

Laura:
I will gladly sign when I know what it is.

Fosco:
Forget about the signature.
I'm urging you, please,
As a man of honor. Be patient.

Marian:
Send the carriage away

Fosco:
In all good conscience
I could not be a witness now.

Glyde:
For God's sake, woman, sign!
I will not stand for it. I will not!

(Sir Percival goes to strike his wife. He is prevented by Fosco and Marian)

Marian:
Stop it! Stop it!

Glyde:
She is still my wife!
She'll do as I say!

Fosco:
Keep your temper, sir!

Glyde:
Stay out of my way!
(To Laura)
You must be confined
Till you see the light

Marian:
This is not a jail!

Fosco:
Sir, this is not right!

Glyde:
She should gladly do
Anything I say
She's a willful child
Who must have her way

Fosco (firmly):
Glyde! You must hold your tongue!
You must not react
You must leave at once
-your good name intact

(Sir Percival leaves)

Fosco (reaching out to Laura):
You'll be fine Lady Glyde

Laura:
Don't touch me

Fosco:
You are safe my dear
You'll be all right
His bark is far worse
Than his spite
His temper flares
Don't be alarmed
He will calm down
You will not be harmed

Marian:
Without your aid
Where would we be?

Fosco:
How could I not?

Laura:
Don't come near me!

Marian:
He's our friend!
Look what he's done.

Marian:
Have faith! She will come.

Laura (startled):
What's that?

Marian:
Hush! Be calm.

(Anne appears to them. Laura and Anne gaze in awe at each other)

Laura:
I look at you and see myself

Anne:
I look at you and see myself

Laura and Anne:
So strange and yet so true
I see my soul in you

Laura:
Almost my living replica

Marian:
It's true!

Anne:
Our every move so similar

Marian:
So much like you!

Laura:
My face but with years of strain

Laura and Anne (to one another):
Your eyes reveal such pain

It's like I've known you all my life
At last it's safe to hope again

Somehow you complete me
I know I can trust you
Here with you
I am safe at last
You were there
You were always there
Like your heart
Beats within my heat
And the truth
It can set us free

Now that we're together
We must help each other

(Suddenly gunshots are heard and the strange sound of hunting horns)

Anne:
I hear them coming
They've come to lock me up!
Don't let them catch me!
Don't let them take me back!

(She starts to run. The women follow her.)

Marian and Laura:
Wait! Anne- Anne we will help you!

(Sir Percival appears with servants)

Men:
The one in white!
She must not get away again.

Glyde (to Laura and Marian):
I thank you both
For having led me straight to her!

(Men try to capture Anne. She turns on Laura)

Anne:
You have betrayed me!
You have set a trap here!

Laura:
No, no believe me!

Anne:
Curse you, Lady Glyde!

Glyde:
Take her back to the asylum!

(The men grab for her. She tries to escape, but is caught again.)

Anne (to Glyde):
You may lock me up forever
But I will set my secret free!
You can't stop me
Now I'll tell the whole world what you did to me!

Glyde:
Shut up her mouth and her horrible lies!

(The men try to gag her.)

Laura:
Let her go!

Marian:
Count Fosco, you've got to help us!

(Fosco goes to Anne. She struggles, screaming. He injects her with a sedative. She faints into the arms of the men- her captors.)

Fosco:
I'm sorry, but the woman was a danger to herself.
I had no choice. It is the best way. I am a doctor

(Sir Percival and Fosco exit with Anne and the other men. The two women are left, shivering and afraid.)

Laura:
We are powerless at the hands of these men!

(Marian puts her arms round her sister)

Marian:
We will not be victims, Laura.
We will right this wrong.

If I could keep this bitter life at bay
Wide awake, in your arms

I cannot undo
I'm lost
Lost in a fantasy that can't come true.

The day is past and over:

Though many are the perils through which I have to go
Oh Lord, keep me in thy sight
And guard me through the coming night.

The playing of the merry organ,

Sweet singing in the choir
Sweet singing in the choir
Sweet singing in the choir
Sing for it's Lammastide
Sing for it's Lammastide
Dance for who knows

If we'll live till the spring
Dance for who knows

If we'll live till the spring

What will protect us? A doll made of corn.

During this, events become gothic and unreal we hear ironic echoes of the story so far - voices swirling and overlapping. Anne Catherick, Laura, Hartright,
Glyde and Fosco all appear to her as if in a dream

Anne:
I can trust you.

Laura:
So strange and yet so true
I see myself?

Marian:
It's true.

Glyde:
I will not stand for it? I will not.

Fosco:
You'll be fine Lady Glyde.

Laura:
I don't trust him or anyone.

Hartright:
Are you happy now?

Marian:
Laura, you know you can trust me.

Laura:
Trust you, now why should I trust you?

Anne:
You have betrayed me.

Glyde:
Take her back to the asylum.

Fosco:
You will not be harmed.

Laura:
Marian wake up!

Anne:
I'll haunt you.

Hartright:
She had a secret she would tell.

Anne:
I'll haunt you till you die.

Laura:
Wake up, help me!

Hartright:
Perhaps I'm not the only one
With secrets.

Fosco:
I'm a doctor. Trust me.

Anne:
They've come to lock me up. No, no!

Glyde:
You must be confined.

Laura:
Marian, what have they done to you?

Fosco:
And I never lie.

Marian:
I would wake and find her
Wake and find her
Find her?

            COUNT FOSCO

Miss Halcombe
It is behatch
I'm so terribly sorry
There is no easy way to say this
Your sister
She is dead
She was walking in her sleep


What are you saying! (sobbing)


She had sent her maid away
As is her custom I understand
She walked to her window
And she fell from a great height you see
It's a tragic accident
I am so deeply sorry
I am leaving for London today
If you need anything
Anything at all
This is where you'll find me

PRIEST (At the graveyard)

I am the life and the resurrection
Said The Lord
Who so ever liveth and believeth in me
Shall never die


How can the good Lord take my love away
Far too young
Far too good
I have to face forever
All without my love
There's no describing my sadness
She was the light of my life
And life is so unfair
Such a cross to bear
Still there's the will to contend with
All kinds of papers to sign
I can't believe she's gone
Yet we must go on

LAURA's UNCLE

How can you talk of business!
Good God it's much too soon!


Of course we'll wait a bit
That's appropriate


I'm much too overcome now
My nerves are simply flayed
Why don't you come to me
In June


Marian
I hope you still think of me as your brother


I don't believe a word
Everything he utters is a lie
I was powerless
Just a woman!
Too weak to save you!
I have no doubt he murdered you!
Laura!
You were all I had
I can't believe your gone
Where is Walter
He's the only one
You and I can count upon
All for Laura
I will be strong
I will live to right
This wrong

(On the Streets of London. Walter Hartright passes by a man begging on the streets)


Spare me a penny
Sir


This is my last one


Then I won't deprive you


Please take it
It's yours

(offering hartright liquor)

It takes some comfort
It'll help you forget sir

            Ever on my mind
Evermore without you
I'll never know a thought or feeling That isn't about you
Nevermore alone
Never to forget you
Not when my life was changed forever The first time I met you
You're all I know
And though I've lost you,
You're someone I can't let go

Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life without you
Or even tomorrow?
Evermore without you
Were we never meant to be?

Nevermore alone
Never to forget you
Not when my life was changed the first Time I met you
You're all I know
And though I've lost you,
You're someone I can't let go

Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life without you
Or even tomorrow?
Evermore without you
Were we never meant to be?

Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life
without you...

Evermore without you
We were never meant to be.

            Lost Souls       
            Lost souls, all of us searching,
Never finding, what we are seeking.
All hope, long ago buried,
Here in London, in a sea of strangers.

We're pris'ners, in darkness,
Rats in a cage,
With anger, and hunger to fuel our rage.
More of the same each bloody day,
Best you should stay, out of our way.

We drink to let go of the life that we know.
It's hopeless, we're caught in the undertow.
Drowning in gin each endless night,
Endlessly spoiling, for a fight.

Marian:
Can you help me? There's a man I'm searching for.
Can you help me? Walter Hartwright is his name.

Questions, all without answers,
And our business, is to forget them.
Lost souls, all of us searching,
Here in London, in a sea of strangers.

We're here to let go of our worries,
Fill your bitter cup.
No need to look forwards or backwards,
Only bottoms up.

Marian:
Please sir help me? There's a man that I must find.
Can you help me? Walter Hartwright is his name.

Conman:
Hartwright? Did you say Walter Hartwright?
Yes I know him, I'll take you to him.
I know him, I'll take you to where he will be,
Delighted to help you, believe you me.

Here among the missing,
A city with no answers,
We're looking for salvation,
In endless desperation,
With gin to dull our senses,
And chase away our demons,
And though we'll never find it,
We'll drink until we're blinded.

I am overcome with shame
Will you let me rebuild the bridge I've set aflame
Can we be as we were
If not for me for her

I know that I've wronged you
And that I can't defend
I hope I haven't
That you're my one true friend

With such sadness
We both live
Though it's unpardonable
I ask you to forgive
Can't we be
As we were?
If not for me
For Her

            You Can Get Away With Anything       
            (Fosco's lodgings in London. We see him at home in a strange,
surreal lair-full of caged animals-birds and mice. He is packing)


Time to fly the coop, my doves!
Arriverderci, Londra! No tears, bambini.
You must learn to far la bella figura!
Put on a good show!
Always Count Fosco-he puts on a good show!

(Fosco performs for his animals)

My little friends you are all in this world
that I trust
Now we must find a new home and I see you're non plussed
Now that we've won
and we' have all the spoils
We must see that we don't miss the boat
But you'll forgive me if I take a moment to gloat

You can get away with anything
It all comes down to style
You'll have a captive
audience
As long as you beguile
Yes you can have your cake and eat it
The love of those whom you betray
But you can't get away with anything
If you don't get away
I admit that I'm a criminal
obsessed with perfect crimes
But even one as good as I
can bungle it sometimes
Yes even one who is a genius
can now and then get in a scrape
But no endeavor's a catastrophe
as long as you escape

And we are off! Out that door!

We'll pack our bags my little friends
and leave the scene while we are winners
And long before the story ends
as wealthy unrepentant sinners
We all have got a spot of farce in us
but only some of us are larcenous
And few still the divine thrill in us
that comes from being truly villainous

You can get away with anything
to prove it is my sport
I live to push the boundaries
to break the rules, in short
One must be something of a bounder
if one intends to play this game
There's only one thing that one has to have
one has to have
no shame
Yes I can get away with everything because I
have no shame

(He is almost completely packed and ready to go,
when a servant enters and announces Marian's arrival)

            Seduction       
            SERVANT

Miss Marian Halcombe

(Fosco is pleasantly surprised. He shoos the servant away.
He slicks back his hair back, adjusts his smoking jacket.
The servant exits as Marian enters)


To what Miss Halcombe do we owe this honour?
Each successive day was getting duller

(as she takes her coat off, revealing her red dress to him for the first time)

Well I somehow thought you might be missing me


I must tell you scarlet is your color


I cannot spend all my life in mourning
Though in ev'ry way I miss my sister


Truly you display a healthy attitude



I'm for the first time on my own


Really you need not be alone
One should explore on'es playful side


You are a guide most qualified


I leave in the morning for the continent


In my provincial world I cannot be content


We could lead a life that would be well mis-spent


And I have no doubt that would be thrilling
But alas it seems my glass requires refilling

(Fosco takes her glass and re-fills it generously-as he does she quickly
and surreptitiously looks on his desk
for the document before hastily arranging herself on the sofa.
He hands her the drink)


Delicious!

Sir if I remove my shoes would that be shocking?


I'd be breathless as your buckles are undone
I would walk to warsaw just to see your stocking
And to see your shapely ankle I would run


You should know it took great courage for this visit
But I must admit that I am glad that I am here


And that dress you're falling out of is exquisite


Though I'm trembling it is clearly not from fear


It's apparent we were made for one another
We're each others moon and sun we're so well matched
Though my feelings aren't remotely like a brother
We are over twenty-one and unattached


I've been waiting all my life for an adventure


What in truth you have been waiting for is me
Let us begin our minuette


No looking back and no regret
Don't I deserve a life of bliss?

FOSCO (intimate)

Think of this as the precipice

(they kiss)


I can open up a world you've only heard of


Introduce me to a life beyond your dreams


We'll share secrets that we'll never breath a word of
And we'll take pursuit of pleasure to extremes


You and I are willing to defy convention
You're my equal both in joie de vivre and wit
We find another worthy of attention
we don't care what others think of us one bit

(they kiss)


As a paramour I'm rather out of practice
But I'll rise to this occasion I embrace


But that bard of yours is rather like a cactus
May I save, if not my virtue then my face?
Would you kindly shave it off
Do be a darling?


Then i will fly back to your side just like a startling

(Fosco leaves to shave.
Marian dashes around the room looking for the document,
opening drawers etc.)

MARIAN (sotto voce)

Think, think Marian. Where is it? Where is it?

(she continues to look. She finds the document, reads it)

MARIAN (sotto voce)

Please! Yes!

(she does not have time to put the paper back, before she hears him approaching.
She hids it about her person.
Fosco re-enters, in the mood for love. She sits herself quickly.)


Now my chin is even softer than a baby
Let's resume this tete a tete from where we were

(She edges away from him)


Though my heart says yes my head's now saying maybe
And my feet are growing colder and concur

(She puts on her shoes again)


When I left this room were we both not on fire?
We'ren't we both about to give romance a whirl?

(She stands up)


On reflection I found out I'm
somewhat shy-er
And perhaps I'm not really that kind of girl

(Fosco pauses, looks at her intensely)


It appears that you have lost your taste for kissing
So I'd appreciate if you'd return what's missing

(Wordlessly she gives the document back to him. He holds onto her a moment)


Please. Please let me go. Please.

(He does so)


This game is through
You think you win
But think about
What might have been
If you had let romance begin
Instead of hiding
In your shell

One day you'll see
What you have spurned
My precious gift
That you returned
A gift for living well

Your every day
A great event
Living on the continent
Yes, it's true
I would have you
spellbound

(she looks away from him)

This game of hearts
You gladly trade
For solitaire
(with venom) and old maid
And so I say fare well


Someday your past will catch you up


Please don't let me keep you

(She leaves. He gathers up all his cases as he prepares for his final exit)


I can get away with ev'rything
Except the girl, perhaps
My epic charms have undergone
a temporary lapse

But when it's time to make an exit
and I am halfway out the door
As long as one is leaving anyway
then leave them wanting more

(he leaves)

            Asylum       
            WOMAN

Yes?
What's your business here?


We are representatives of Sir Percival Glyde
We're here to see Anne Cattrick.


I feel so nervous


You've been so brave


There is something
I must say to you
Something i've held deep inside for so long


Only one of you

(the woman leads marian through the patients in the asylum to Anne)

Cattrick
You can have five minutes
Not that you'll get much sense from her

(marian approaches anne)

Anne?
Anne Cattrick

(Marian realizes that it is infact her sister Laura and not Anne Cattrick)


Laura?


Marian? MARIAN!
(They embrace)


How can this be?


They held me down and drugged me
They dressed me in Anne's clothing


I was sure I heard some screaming
But they told me I was dreaming!


They brought me here that evening
Underneath a cloud of darkness
Though I told them who I was
There was no one who believed me!


Then it was Anne they buried
Claiming it was you!


What?


There isn't time now
We must get out of here!
We've got to stop Glyde before he gets away!

I will redeem this pledge


Marian I don't understand!
What have they done to Anne!
Tell me!


Oh Laura I am so sorry!
Anne Cattrick is dead!


What?


I believe they killed her


And put you in this asylum in her place


Please God No!


Laura I am so sorry


Then her secret has gone with her to the grave!


We musn't think about this now
We have to get you to safety


But we must know her secret


She's right
We have to go to Limmeridge


Limmeridge?


We are but three miles away
And your uncle knows more than he's admitting
It's time for him to tell the truth!
                Last Update: January, 13th 2014

            Back to Limmeridge       
            PERCIVAL GLIDE

Here use this pen
Sign here and here
And we'll be done


There is just the small question of my future
Limmeridge house has been my home for many years
You have no plans to sell, Sir?


No immediate plans


Then my future here is assured?
I'm old sir and infirmed


I am well aware of that


So you have no plans?


I leave straight from here for a long sanget on the continent. My seat on the train is booked.
Sir, your signature.


Her estate is yours
Spend it wisely Glyde


Thank you kindly sir


Tragic that she died
Stay and have one drink
In memory of my niece


I have to catch my train


May she rest in peace


But sir
I can't miss the train


Don't haunt me in this way
Brother I have done your dirty work for far too long
For years i've kept your secrets
I've brought up your children
They weren't mine
This has brought me ill health, unhappiness
That's your legacy!
I wanted no part of this


You can't go in there!


We have some pressing questions!


Explain this rude intrusion!


You must tell us who's Anne Cattrick!


Uncle you have got to help us!


I don't know what you speak of


There's no more time for secrets


Long ago her mother worked here


We won't leave without an answer


What presumption! Know your place sir!


ALl along you've known the truth sir


Good God Anne Cattrick is dead sir!
She lies in Laura's grave


What nonsense you speak of!
It is Laura who is dead
God rest her soul!
My niece is dead

(Music begins to play on the piano. It is Laura's song)

What witchcraft is this?


Come believe your eyes Uncle
I was placed in the asylum
Anne went to my grave
If you ever loved me Uncle tell me who she was


Your father loved the ladies
Anne's mother was a pretty one
You can guess the rest
Though you and Anne were born a year apart
You could easily have passed for twins
Save you were wanted
And she was not


She was my sister?


Yes


And Glyde killed her


What?


He won't get away with this


I'm afraid he already has
He's on his way to the Continent
Your estate has already passed to him
He left just before you arrived


What is this secret my sister spoke of?
Uncle do you know?


I assure you
I know nothing more
I'm sorry


Then it is over
Glyde has won


We can catch him
We can hit him off
He'll need to take the London train


I'll go with you
Laura you rest here


No! I'll never rest again
We can stop him
I have a plan!
Anne shall haunt him
One last time

            Finale       
            SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE

Hello!
You there!
Signalman!
Where in hell in the damn London train!


I've heard reports there's trouble on the line!


That isn't expected!
My business here is over
I must make my connection
And why do you look at me in that way?
I've done nothing wrong!
What is that infernal noise!


It's the wires singing in the wind
They're calling me with news sir
There's danger on the line!


This terrible nosie in my head!
Aahh!
Oh God, Anne Cattrick?
This isn't real
This cannot be
You do not exist
Get away from me!


You know why I'm here
And what you must say
So you must confess


Woman Stay away


Tell the truth Percival Glyde!
You'll hear my voice inside your head
For all you're life and when you're dead
You won't be free until you express what you have done
Till you confess
You cannot hide!
You can't go far!
Everywhere you go i'll be where you are!
I know what you've done!
We both know it's true!
Secrets must be told


I'm not afraid of you.


Everything you did
Every one will know!


That's all in the past buried long ago


Tell the truth Percival Glyde!
Didn't you use me and hurt me!


You were a beautiful girl
Like none i'd ever seen
You were just fifteen


You and I both know the secret


Something that no one could prove
And who'd believe it's true
From the likes of you
You told me you were pregnant
You told me it was mine
It could have been alive
It deserved to die
I had to drown your bastard
I had no other choice
Before the child was due
I'd had enough of you
All that remains of your secret
Is buried in Black Water Lake
I watched as your disgrace
Sank without a trace


You beat me and you raped me
And then you drowned my child!
When I was mad from grief you imprisoned me!
My precious little baby
My heart within my heart
The child I never knew
All because of you!
And then you threw away my life!


Your precious secret's meaningless
No one alive remembers you
And you can save your prayers
For no one truly cares
It's just like you were never born
And no one ever mourned for you!

('Anne Cattrick' takes off the white veil shielding her face and reveals
that it is truly Laura and not Anne Cattrick)


You're wrong!
I mourned for Anne! Anne Cattrick!
And the child of yours that you destroyed!


Laura!


This secret seals your fate forever!
And the charge that you can't avoid!
You have kept us both a prisoner!
But the truth has set us free
It will lock you up and damn your soul
For all of eternity!


You little witch
You think you can trick me?
Come here!
I killed her
And I can kill you too
And the beauty of it is
No one will ever know
Because you're dead!
You're already dead!

(Walter Hartright emerges from his hiding spot and he fights with Percival Glyde)


He's over there!
We know exactly what you've done!


You see Glyde we all know what you've done!
You've found your own confession!
The game is over!


The game is never over!


Don't go in there!
He said there's danger on the line!

(Sir Percival Glyde runs into the dark tunnel where an oncoming train hits and kills him)


And a year to the day
The dead lie on the tracks
The dead lie on the tracks


You were so brave and now we're free


It seemed like Anne was there with me
Her spirit was my guide
My sister by my side


Within I know we'll never part
Her heart beats on within my heart


Go to her right away
That it where to belong!


How can I ask your blessing
With all that we've been through
Our world has changed


You must find it in your heart
To over look what we've done
And make another start
Once again
As we were
If not for me
For Her


Everypart of every thought
Leads me straight to you


And with all my soul
I believe my heart
The portrait that it paints of you
Is a perfect work of art


I close my eyes!
And I still see his face!

~FIN~
