It is patently clear
Any awkwardness here
Can be cleared up in less than a trice
Our identity switch
Who is who, which is which
We're in need of some solid advice
There's a painfully simple solution
It's as plain as the nose on your face
By gad!
By gosh!
By heck!
By gum!
By rabbit's foot!
By kingdom come!
By all my sainted aunt believes!
By George!
By Jove!
By Jeeves!
When we're faced with the grind
Of exerting the mind
We are filled with a deep sense of dread
"How on earth," I hear cries
"Does one give exercise
To a thing that's in bed in your head?"
What we need is a free range consultant
Where on earth do you find one of those?
By hook! By crook!
By way! By pass!
By sea! By air!
By road!
By grass!
By seven dwarves!
By forty thieves!
By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
By shuttlecock!
By croquet hoop!
By Panama!
By Windsor soup!
By all those cards tucked up his sleeves!
By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
Our collective I.Q.
Of around 42
Cannot cope, to be perfectly frank
All true leaders of men
Delegate now and then
Try to keep their minds totally blank
To appreciate loftier matters
Things that mostly go over my head
By derby day!
By nursery tea!
By moose!
By spoons!
By half past three!
By every tender breast that heaves!
By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
By marmalade!
By bowler hat!
By toothpaste tube!
By Burmese cat!
By baby newts!
By autumn leaves!
By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
Behold how Jeeves with sleight of hand
Conceives a scheme so carefully planned
Even we can understand
If he takes it terribly slow - ly
By Basingstoke!
By cardboard box!
By Budge's knees!
By Bassett's socks!
By each that conjuror deceives!
By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
By jumping jack!
By easy chair!
By Bain Marie!
By Camembert!
By every fruit bat in the eaves!
By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
By walking boot!
By thermal drawers!
By canapes!
By Santa Claus!
By all his mighty brain achieves!
By every spell the master weaves!
By heck! By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!
By Jeeves! By Jeeves! By Jeeves!
By Jeeves!
Who are you? Someone quick! There's a man broken in!
In a pig mask, broken in my bedroom!
Stand well clear! He's all mine!
I can deal with this swine
With this chauvinist pig in my bedroom!
When I'm through, I will bet
You will live to regret
that you picked on me, you and I ever met
I'm teaching you a lesson that you never will forget
You're a pig! What a pig! What a pig!
Oh dear, help! It's a pig! Daddy, help it's a pig!
There's a beastly piggy in my bedroom
Cornered! He's cornered!
Is it real or a dream?
Get away, or I'll scream!
Who on earth let this pig in my bedroom?
Lend a hand! Bar the door!
And we've trapped him for sure
I shall die if the thing makes a mess on my floor...
Speaking as a woman who has hunted wild boar
What's a pig, more or less? What's a pig?
Now we've got him!
Look, it's Bertie...
Nice and easy...
It's so dirty!
Listen, Maddy...
Don't come near me!
Don't dare touch her, do you hear me!
Oh, this damn thing's stuck completely!
Exit Wooster, swift and sweetly!
Follow that pig!
Bless my soul! Who are you? What on earth's going on?
There's a circus artist in my bedroom
Stop him!
We've got him!
Can't believe both my eyes
There's a chap in disguise
There's a cat burgling pig in my bedroom
Careful, girls, all stand back
He may try to attack...
It's a well known fact that they hunt as a pack
Wait while I distract him, try to put him off the track
Watch that pig!
Watch the pig!
Watch the pig!
Listen, people...
Don't you try it!
Tried to kiss me
I deny it!
Oh, you swine you!
Caught him looting!
Raise your hands or I'll start shooting!
With a badly bruised libido
Exit Wooster tres rapido
Follow that pig!
Hunt the pig! Hunt the pig! Hunt the two-legged pig!
There's a pig loose somewhere in the house here
Find him!
And catch him!
Everybody look out
For the glimpse of a snout
For the click of his trotters on the stairway
There he is!
False alarm!
We must try to keep calm
I'm afraid! I'm afraid!
Then take hold of my arm
I'll let him have both barrels, it'll work just like a charm
On the pig
Steady on!
There's the pig!
There's the pig! There's the pig! There's the housebreaker pig!
There's the pig with criminal intentions
Once he's caught there is talk
We'll reduce him to pork
In a way that's too terrible to mention
Can't escape, now he's caught
He can grunt he can snort
It's a great new game, chasing porkers for sport
Now we've got him cornered there's a lesson to be taught
To the pig, to the pig, to the pig
Did you see that couple there?
Can't say I did...
Standing by the tree?
Really? Was it raining?
That was nearly us back there
Don't quite follow...
Nearly you and me
Oh yes, I see. Brrmmm!
Bertie, you've been badly neglected
You need a wife who'll correct it
The secret with men, of course, is
To treat them a bit like horses...
Did you see those lovers there?
No, I think they were pheasants, actually...
Even you could see
Oh, lovers! I thought you said plovers, sorry.
Oh, so nearly us back there
Was it? Nearly ran over them, then...
Nearly you and me
Appear to be running out of cardboard...
Could it be we took some wrong turning?
Is this a lesson worth learning?
Can't you see that couple there
Could well have been you and me?
Hump back bridge!
That was nearly us back there
Wouldn't you concur?
Hairpin bend, hang on...
He was so like you back there
I could have been her
No, I think they were both very much shorter.
Here you are, so vital, attractive-
Would that your brain was as active
You're nobody's intellectual
You hot-blooded het'rosexual...
Oh, now, simmer down...
Was it merely lucky chance
Brought us here today?
Victims both of circumstance
Meeting you this way
Brrrrmmmm! Brrrrrmmmm!!
It's as though our lives had been frozen
Back on the paths we'd both chosen
Giving us a fleeting glimpse
Of all that was meant to be
That was surely us back there
It's as clear as day
If we'd both kept faith back there
Hadn't lost our way
Nearly there ... Here's the village
What if we defied dull convention?
Stood up to shout our intention?
Steady!
If we'd followed our heart's volition
and shed our last inhibition?
Here we are! At last!
That's out future life back there
Cheerio then!
Bertie, can't you see?
You'd better hop in there smartish...
That was meant for us back there
You don't want to get gangrene...
All we're meant to be
Time we took the plain facts and faced them
Turned in our tracks and retraced them
Back to when that couple there
So clearly were you and me...
I've invariably found
That feet kept on the ground
Allow the grass to grow
Check your mirrors front and rear
Slip smoothly into gear
Then hit the road and go
Feel the pistons steady beat
The camshaft 'neath your feet
That big end start to fly...
May I advise a modicum of caution, sir...
He who hesitates is lost
Burn bridges once they're crossed
Don't stop to say goodbye
There is a blind corner approaching, sir...
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Hark the mistle-thrush's cry
The hedge-rows rushing by
The curlew on the wing
That is a crow, sir.
List! Some distant church's bells
'Midst bracing country smells
Those fields of golden - thing...
Corn, sir.
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Travel's broadened out my mind
Until today you'll find...
The widest head I know...
Thank you, Jeeves. You did say wisest, didn't you?
Oh yes, sir.
Every traveller I meet
I'll always stop to greet
Be careful how you go, sir...
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Travel hopefully with me
And I will guarantee
There'll be no pause for doubt
Hit the nearest country track
No time for looking back
Look onwards and - look out!!!!
What have you got to say, Jeeves?
What have you got to say?
Sir -
Your job's to protect me and to cushion me from shocks
Not to let the poor young master end up crouching in a box
Leave him posing as a coatstand there, the minute someone knocks
No, somebody's got to pay, Jeeves
Somebody's got to pay
If you would allow me, sir -
Threatened with a lynch mob and I lose my oldest friends
I'm embroiled with random females bent on dire romantic ends
Yours is frankly not a judgement, Jeeves, on which a chap depends
It's bordering on risque, Jeeves
Utterly declasse...
If I might -
Your job's to inspire me with encouragement and praise
Not abandon me with Stiffy in some frightful leafy maze
Not to make me change my name three times in just as many days
Here I am in an extreme position
General Custer out of ammunition
Didn't get here by my own volition
As Tennyson once thundered
Someone here has badly blundered
Sir -
It's chaos and disarray, Jeeves
Misery and dismay
Perhaps if i could interr -
Calling this a shambles is to understate the case
Look at all these banjo lovers, not a dry eye in the place
I shall never have the nerve again to look them in the face
So what have you got to say, Jeeves?
What have you got to say?
I fear I must confess it, sir
Despite my best endeavours to
Ensure a fluid narrative
Things haven't gone to plan
Evens were overtaken, sir
By unseen technicalities
I really can assure you, though
I've done the best I can
There comes the odd occasion, sir
When facing up to destiny
We'd do as well as well remembering
A man is but a man
You have my firm assurances
That come the grand denouement, sir
Events will all resolve themselves
In spite of come what may
I only can apologize
For any inconvenience
Injurious to your dignity
That happens on the way
I simply wish to emphasize
I have your interests uppermost
And that, sir, in conclusion, sir
Is all I have to say!
Who's the man you've all been sitting there anticipating?
Whos' the man with his instrument ready, willing and waiting?
Who's the man for whom your breath has been eagerly baiting?
If I hadn't already confessed it
You'd no doubt already have guessed it
Banjo boy, banjo boy, play a number for me
Won't you play that melody?
When you start your plain' - Mama starts a-swayin'
She's right there with 'em - stompin' that rhythym
Banjo boy, banjo boy, play the razzamatazz
You're the sunny southland's king
You set Dixie hummin' it - when you started strummin' it
See those fingers goin'
When you start to syncopate
Songbirds seem to orchestrate
The Swanee stops it's flowin'
Just hear him play
Who can plunk your heartstrings full of joy
That's banjo boy
Hear him go
Don't you know
Love him so
Let him swing
And do his thing
He's the king
Ring-a-ding
Banjo boy, banjo boy, you're the musical sun
In those southern sunny skies
Feet will start their fidgets - see those magic digits
Hands are a clappin' - fingers a snappin'
Banjo boy, banjo boy, play that favourite tune
That the old folks love to sing
Can't you hear the people cry
Wann see those fingers fly
Listen to him playin'
Can't you hear those children roar
Dixie's shoutin' out for more
Hear the steamboats blowin'
Eight to the bar
Who's that cotton pickin' hunk of joy?
That golden kid that fashion can't destroy?
Whose name they shout from Maine to Illinois?
That's banjo boy!
Banjo boy!
Time, they say, is relative
Infinite as space
This must be eternity
Neither time nor place...
Half a moment
We are together
I shall want
Half a moment
I shall treasure
Keep it locked away
For some future rainy day
Should you leave me
With just this moment
In my mind, I will capture it anew
Like some picture
Taken in my childhood
Half a moment
Spent with you
Time looks kindly
On fleeting lovers
They can turn
The briefest hour into a day
Turn a moment
To a lifetime
Making it to last
Blending future with the past...
Ev'ry moment
We spend together
I don't care
What they say or try to do
Can't erase it
All that's gone between us
Shared with you
Half a moment
We are together
I shall want
No one else and nothing new
Half a moment
I shall treasure
Keep it locked away
For some future rainy day
We're together
What else can matter?
Even though half a moment
Is too few
I shall save it
Till I have another
Making one whole moment
Filled with you
Deep in love's maze
There my heart strays
Caught in a flurry of worry and doubt
Down love's pathways
There my heart plays
Whispering secrets it's longing to shout
All I need's a sympathetic friend
To help me find a way to leave -
Love's maze is a magical labyrinth
Close paths hidden far from gaze
Love's maze is for lovers in jeopardy
Lost there in a rainbow haze
Won't you save me?
Please assist me
Help me decipher its intricate ways?
Love has touched me
Love has kissed me
Holding me prisoner deep in this maze
Well, you can't blame me. Cupid never pays
You'll saunter round for day's inside love's -
Love's maze is a mystical wonderland
Conceals what the heart conveys
Love's maze is a puzzle in paradise
Misleads all the eye surveys
I did warn you
I have sworn to
Steer a wide berth, for I know to my cost
It's predicted
Self-inflicted
People in mazes do tend to get lost
All I need's a very special friend
To rescue me from here inside
Love's maze is a crazy kaleidoscope
All roads leading diff'rent ways
Love's maze, like a swaying calliope
One dance where the piper pays
Love's maze is a hatter's mad party time
One feast lasting nights and days
Love's maze is a firework spectacular
Bright skies as the bonfires blaze
All praise as we dance in its corridors
All part of these grand displays
Behold every lover who's ever born
All lost in their own love's maze
All I need's a little help from you...
You'll never drag me there inside love's -
Love's maze is a crazy kaleidoscope
All roads leading diff'rent ways
Love's maze, like a swaying calliope
One dance where the piper pays
Love's maze is a hatter's mad party time
One feast lasting nights and days
Love's maze is a firework spectacular
Bright skies as the bonfires blaze
Love's maze is a magical labyrinth
Close paths hidden far from gaze
Love's maze is for lovers in jeopardy
Lost there in a rainbow haze
All praise as we dance in its corridors
All part of these grand displays
Behold every lover who's ever born
All lost in their own love's maze
I obey the Code of the Woosters. It's a simple philosophy.
When perhaps a chap's in trouble. I respond with alacrity.
And if my fellow men have problems
Whatever they might be
They call on me
The sterling Wooster B.
For despite
This easy nature
Come the evening
When battle dawns
To see a Wooster
Grab the livestock by both the horns
For when a Wooster's mask of pleasure
Becomes a steely stare
You'll know he's there
He'll never turn a hair
What would a chap do without it?
How would he get through without it?
How could he stay true wihtout the Code of the Woosters?
If you're at sea, I shall be there, even put off tea to be there
Woosters have swum oceans for the Code of
Allegiance duly owed to the Wooster Code
What a load
If a girl
Is in the doldrums
Not a paddle
To her name
I'll be there
Though frankly speaking
Womanizing's not my game
But if she's really in a lather
Wild eyed and hat askew
He'll see her through
Old you know who...
Whenever it calls, can't ignore it, even give up Ascot for it
Woosters have died gladly for the code of
For that rugged, heavy load called the Wooster Code
What a load
Take my card
In case you need me, if you're jousting a losing cause
Like the chap
Who wins the double
I can rattle
The natural laws
So if you're eaten up with anguish
I'll snatch you from its jaws
No second's pause
From one sincerely yours...
It's alright!
He's on call both day and night
Turning darkness into light
Ubique illuminatus
Wooster is ready to fight!
Wooster is ready to fight!
It's an English tradition
We like to say hallo
We hope by shaking hands that we'll recall your name
We work on that basis, remembering faces
But that's about all
I know you're somebody something
It's on the tip of my tongue
You're either Edith Sitwell or the Bow Street Beak
I'll know who you are, the moment you speak ...
But meanwhile, just put in right there
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Hallo again...
How goes it all?
Good day to you
You keeping fit?
So great to meet you
It's been an age
A tiny world
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you do?
How's life with you?
Good evening all
You're looking well
Well, hi there, stranger
Surprise, surprise
What could be nicer, meeting like this?
I confess I've forgotten
Who on earth you can be
It could be you're Nijinsky or the man next door-
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you do?
You're either Pablo Picasso
Or maybe Harpo Marx
You might be Sarah Bernhardt - no, you're Wittgenstein
Whoever I am though, the pleasure's all mine
Let's take it and shake it right there
Well, fancy this
It's surely not?
I can't believe
Good Lord alive!
How long's it been?
You've hardly changed
You've lost some weight
I can't believe it!
It's been a while
You're just the same
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you do?
What brings you here?
How's life back home?
How's business been?
And how's your father?
My sainted aunt!
What could be better, meeting like this?
Though I haven't an inkling
Not a clue who you are
You could be Amy Johnson
No, I'm Al Capone. How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you -
How do you do?
Aren't you Marlene Dietrich?
I think I'm Bernard Shaw
It really doesn't matter who on earth you are
The truth of it all is our friendship's been far
Too long now to bother with names
It's just another episode
In the Wooster moral code
Let's extend the hand of greeting
Hallo there, whoever you are
How do you do
Sounds sweet
Goes like a bird. Hold on to your hat.
Hey, this is more like it...
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Travel hopefully with me
Let all your thoughts run free
We can't have come this far...
What's that?
Nothing
Till with any luck you'll feel
Your inner voice reveal
Just where the hell we are
Hopeful travellers me and you
But the point of all this, let's face it, is that it's not what Gussie says, surely.
It's what he feels. I mean, love's a funny thing. It doesn't always look quite the same.
It varies from person to person, if you follow. I mean, with Budge it's a brisk covering in jam,
but with Gussie, it's more subtle - more oblique - like - steamed fish - it creeps up on you...
When love arrives, it's hard to tell
He doesn't ring the front door bell
He doesn't wait politely in the hall
Or leave his card
He doesn't wait to wipe his feet
In fact he's not at all discreet
He doesn't phone to warn you he will call and means to stay
He may not come when you're expecting him to visit -
But if he does, make sure he finds you home
Surrender now, for what's the use?
And wave that friendly flag of truce
Just rush right out to greet him
Don't hesitate at all, dear
You'll bless the day that love rings your bell
Ding! Ding!
Hallo?
Who's there?
It's love
Come in
Kiss, kiss
Hee-hee!
So close your eyes and lend an ear
For I suspect he's somewhere near
And that it's you that he has come to find
Oh Bertie, dear...
So let him hold you tight and snug -
Like kittens cuddled in a rug?
Well, that's the sort of thing I had in mind...
Oh look, my dear!
Each dandelion clock is very softly chiming
To tell the flowers it's time to go to bed
What's that she said?
I know this night can't be in vain
The stars shine in God's daisy chain
And even Mr. Moon's begun to snore...
Good grief, no more...
Look, softly now, just close your eyes -
And will I get a big surprise?
What else d'you think I'm doing all this for
You lovely thing, you?
Just wait right there till love himself arrives
Wait there...stay there...right there...don't move...stay put...
