In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind.
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
Your My spirit and my your voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is here
Inside my your mind
He's there, the phantom of the opera!
Beware, the phantom of the opera!1
In all your fantasies, you always knew
that man and mystery
Were both in you
And in this labyrinth
where night is blind
the Phantom of the Opera is here,
inside my your mind
He's there, the phantom of the opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel!
Sing for me!
No more talk of darkness,
forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom,
let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
to guard you and to guide you.
Say you love me every waking moment,
turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
promise me that all you say is true,
that's all I ask of you.
Let me be your shelter,
let me be your light;
you're safe, no one will find you,
your fears are far behind you.
All I want is freedom,
a world with no more night;
and you, always beside me,
to hold me and to hide me.
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
say the word and I will follow you.
Share each day with me,
each night, each morning.
Say you love me!
You know I do.
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade . . .
Masquerade!
Hide your face,
so the world will
never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade . . .
Masquerade!
Look around -
there's another
mask behind you!
Flash of mauve . . .
Splash of puce . . .
Fool and king . . .
Ghoul and goose . . .
Green and black . . .
Queen and priest . . .
Trace of rouge . . .
Face of beast . . .
Faces . . .
Take your turn, take a ride
on the merry-go-round . . .
in an inhuman race . . .
Eye of gold . . .
Thigh of blue . . .
True is false . . .
Who is who . . .?
Curl of lip . . .
Swirl of gown . . .
Ace of hearts . . .
Face of clown . . .1
Faces . . .
Drink it in, drink it up,
till you've drowned
in the light . . .
in the sound . . .
But who can name the face . . .?
ALL
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows,
spinning reds . . .
Masquerade!
Take your fill -
let the spectacle
astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances,
turning heads . . .
Masquerade!
Stop and stare
at the sea of smiles
around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows
breathing lies . . .
Masquerade!
You can fool
any friend who
ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs,
peering eyes . . .
Masquerade!
Run and hide -
but a face will
still pursue you!1
What a night
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme
de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears
are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghost!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast:
to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
And may its
splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it
(Spoken)
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
Just think of it.
But, why a secret?
What have we to hide?
No, Raoul, please don't let them see
Well let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
(Sung)
Christine, what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue
(Let's not argue)
Please pretend
(I can only hope)
You will understand in time
(I'll understand in time)
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade!
Hide your face,
so the world
will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade!
Look around,
there's another mask
behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade!
Stop and stare
at the sea of smiles
around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows,
Spinning reds
Masquerade!
Take your fill,
let the spectacle
astound you!
(Voices fade and turn to gasps as the lights dim and the Phantom appears at the top of the stairways )
Why so silent, good Messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good Messieurs?
I have written you an opera.
Here, I bring the finished score.
Don Juan Triumphant!
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best
It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though
Should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me, her teacher
Her teacher...
Your chains are still mine,
(spoken)
You belong to me!
Think of me, think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me, once in a while
Please, promise me you'll try
And you'll find that once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said "our love was evergreen"
Or "as unchanging as the sea"
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me trying too hard
To put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine? Bravo!
Long ago, it seemed so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me,
But I remember her
Flowers fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have their seasons, so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah
Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I compose the music of the night1
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Down once more to the dungeon of my black despair...
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind...
Down that path into darkness deep as hell!
Why, you ask,
Was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin,
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
Track down this murderer,
He must be found!
Hunt down this murderer,
He must be found!
Hounded out by everyone,
Met with hatred everywhere,
No kind words from anyone,
No compassion anywhere...
Christine...
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes...
At the level of your eyes...
Your hand at the level of your eyes... (At the level of your eyes...)
Have you gorged yourself at last
In your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey
to your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me
To wallow in blood
Has also denied me
The joys of the flesh.
This face, this infection
Which poisons our love...
This face which earns
A mother's fear and loathing.
A mask, my first
Unfeeling scrap of clothing.
Pity comes too late!
Turn around and face your fate!
An eternity of this
Before your eyes...
This haunted face
Holds no horror for me now.
It's in your soul
That the true distortion lies...
Wait!
I think, my dear,
We have a guest.
Sir...
Raoul!
This is indeed
An unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped
That you would come.
And now, my wish comes true.
You have truly made my night!
Free her!
Do what you like, only free her!
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea...
Please, Raoul
It's useless!
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
Show some compassion!
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine, Christine...
Let me see her!
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome.
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay
For the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now,
Except, perhaps, Christine...
Start a new life with me.
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed
For your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate!
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me...
I did it all for you,
And all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered!
Too late for turning back...
Too late for prayers and useless pity...
Say you love him
And my life is over...
Past all hope of cries for help.
No point in fighting,
For either way you choose you cannot win.
(Either way you choose he has to win!)
So do you end your days with me,
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Past the point of no return
Angel of Music...
For pity's sake, Christine, say no!
Who deserves this?
The final threshold...
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
Why do you curse mercy?
His life is now the prize
Which you must earn!
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music...
You've passed the point of no return!
You deceived me!
I gave my mind, blindly!
You try my patience...
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer,
He must be found!
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this.
Leave me alone,
Forget all you've seen.
Go now don't let them find you,
Take the boat.
Swear to me, never to tell.
The secret you know of the angel in Hell.
Go now! Go now, and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...1
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night!
Brava brava bravisima...
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Really you were perfect.
I only wish I knew your secret.
Who is your great tutor?
Father was spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear.
Now as I sing I can sense him.
And I know he's here.
Here in this room he calls me softly.
Somewhere inside hiding.
Somehow I know he's always with me.
He the unseen genius.
Christine, you must have been dreaming.
Stories like this can't come true.
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you.
Here in this room he calls me softly.
Somewhere inside hiding.
Somehow I know he's always with me.
He the unseen genius.
Christine, you must have been dreaming.
Stories like this can't come true.
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you.
Your public needs you!
We need you too!
Would you not rather have your
precious little ingenue?
Signora, no.
The world wants you.
Prima donna,
first lady of the stage!
Your devotees
are on their knees
to implore you!
Can you bow out
when they're shouting
your name?
Think of how they all adore you.
Prima donna,
enchant us once again
Think of your muse...
And of the queues
round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Andre and Firmin-
Sing, prima donna,
once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna,
your song shall live again!
Think of your public!
You took a snub,
but there's a public
who needs you!
She has heard the voice
of the angel of music...
Those who hear your voice
liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry
of undying
support!
Is this her angel of music...?
We get our opera...
She gets her limelight!
Follow where the limelight
leads you!
Is this ghost
an angel or a madman...?
Angel or madman...?
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna,
your song shall never die!
Voice of hell, or of heaven...?
Heaven help you,|those who doubt...
You'll sing again,
and to unending
ovation!
Orders! Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
This miscasting
Will invite damnation...
Tears... oaths...
lunatic demands
are regular occurrences!
Bliss or damnation?
Which has claimed her...?
Think how you'll shine
in that final
encore!
Sing, prima donna,
once more!
Oh fools,
to have flouted his warnings!
Surely, for her sake...
Surely he'll strike back...
Surely there'll be further scenes -
worse than this!
Think, before
these demands are rejected!
...I must see these demands are rejected!
...if his threats
and demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva
happy to relieve a
girl, who's gone
and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette,
entwined in love's duet!
Although he may demur,
he must have been with her!
Christine must be protected!
O, fortunata!
Non ancor
abbandonata!
You'd never get away
with all this in a play,
but if it's loudly sung
and in a foreign tongue,
it's just the sort of story
audiences adore, in fact a perfect
opera!
His game is over!
This is a game
you cannot hope to win!
And in Box Five
a new game will begin...
For, if his curse
is on this opera...
But if his curse
is on this opera...
Prima donna,
the world is at your feet!
A nation waits,
and how it hates,
to be cheated!
The stress that falls upon a
famous prima donna!
Terrible deseases,
coughs and colds and sneezes!
Still, the dryest throat
will reach the highest note,
in search of perfect
opera!
...then I fear the outcome...
Christine plays the Pageboy,
Carlotta plays the Countess...
...should you dare to...
...when you once again...
Light up the stage
with that age-old rapport!
Sing, prima donna,
once more!
So, it is war between us! If these demands are not met, a disaster
beyond your imagination... will occur!
Once more!
Past the point of no return, no backward glances
Our games of make believe are at an end
Past all thought of if or when, no use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return, the final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence, silence
I have come here, hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining defenceless and silent
And now I am here with you
No second thoughts, I've decided, decided
Past the point of no return, no going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong, one final question
How long should we two wait, before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return, the final threshold
The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you here beside you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of
What is it? What has happened?
Ubaldo! Oh my God! My God!
We're ruined Andre, ruined!
Monsieur le Vicomte!
Come with me!
Oh my darling, my darling!
Who has done this to you?
You! Why did you let this happen?
Monsieur le Vicomte
I know where they are
But can I trust you?
You must, but remember
Your hand at the level of your eyes!
But why, why?
The Punjab lasso, Monsieur
First Buquet, now Piangi
Like this, Monsieur I'll come with you
No, Meg! No, you stay here!
Come with me, Monsieur
Hurry, or we shall be too late!
I remember
there was mist . . .
swirling mist
upon a vast, glassy lake . . .
There were candles
all around
and on the lake there
was a boat,
and in the boat
there was a man . . .
Who was that shape
in the shadows?
Whose is the face
in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying
Pandora!
You little demon -
is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little Iying
Delilah!
You little viper!
now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you . . .
Curse you . . .
Stranger
than you dreamt it -
can you even
dare to look
or bear to
think of me:
this loathsome
gargoyle, who
burns in hell, but secretly
yearns for heaven,
secretly . . .
secretly . . .
But, Christine . . .
Fear can
Turn to love - you'll
learn to see, to
find the man
behind the
this... repulsive
carcass, who
seems a beast, but secretly
dreams of beauty,
secretly...
secretly...
Oh, Christine.
Come we must return -
those two fools
who run my theatre
will be missing you.
Insolent boy, this slave of passion.
Basking in your glory. Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor. Sharing in my triumph!
Angel, I hear you. Speak, I listen. Stay by my side. Guide me. Angel, my soul was weak; forgive me. Enter at last, Master.
Flattering child, you shall know me. See why in shadow I hide. Look at your face in the mirror. I am there inside.
(Christine turns her head to the mirror where the Phantom is beginning to appear)
Angel of music, guide and guardian, grant to me your glory. Angel of music, hide no longer. Come to me, strange Angel.
I am your Angel of Music. Come to the angel of music...
I am your Angel of Music. Come to the Angel of Music...
Monsieur Andre!
Monsieur Firmin!
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed
Well, one does one's best
Here's to us
A toast for the city!
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here!
Masquerade!  Paper faces on parade Masquerade!  Hide your face so the world will never find you Masquerade!  Every face a different shade Masquerade!  Look around, there's another mask behind you.
Flash of mauve Splash of puce Fool and king Ghoul and goose Green and black Queen and priest Trace of rouge Face of beast Faces! Take your turn, take a ride On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race Eye of gold True is false Who is who? Curl of lip Swirl of gown Ace of hearts Face of clown Faces! Drink it in, drink it up Till you've drowned In the light In the sound But who can name the face?
Masquerade!  Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade!  Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you Masquerade!  Burning glances, turning heads Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you.
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud! All the crème, De la crème
Mystery after gala night
It says mystery of soprano's flight
Mystified all the papers say
We are mystified, we suspect foul play
Bad news on soprano's scene
First Carlotta now Christine
Still, at least, the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold
Diva tenders resignation
Cover does a moonlight flit
Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre please don't shout!
It's publicity!
And the take is vast
Free publicity!
But we have no cast!
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Ah, it seems you've got one too
Dear Andre what a charming gala,
Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster, must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime!?!
Dear, Firmin
Just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the ghost by return of post
P.T.O
No one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed!
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain
These are both signed O.G.
Who the hell is he?
Opera Ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He is mocking our position!
In addition he wants money!
What a funny apparition!
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer, he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae
Where is she?
Well how should we know?
I want an answer!
I take it that you sent me this note!
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark!
Monsieur dont argue!
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote? Written!
Do not fear for Miss Daae
The angel of music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again.
If you didn't write it, then who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron
Where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter
A letter which I rather resent
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me that this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered
Christine Daae...
Christine Daae!
...will be singing on your behalf tonight
Be prepared for a great misfortune
Should you attempt to take her place.
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name--!
Miss Daae has returned.
I hope no worse for wear as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best she was alone
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, Monsieur
She will see no one
Will she sing, will she sing?
Here, I have a note
Let me see it!
Please
Gentlemen,
I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature
Detailing how my theatre is to be run
You have not...
followed my instructions
I shall give you one last chance
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent, which makes my casting, in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five
Which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored
A disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant
O.G.
Christine!
Whatever next?
It's all a plot to help Christine!
This is insane...
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte -- her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O menititori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
This man is mad!
We dont take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy -- the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows...
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora
We beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears
I must see her...
Abbandonata!
Deseredata!
O, sventurata!
The angel sees, the angel hears...
Where did she go...?
Abbandonata!
Disgraziata!
Signora, sing for us!
Dont be a martyr...
What new surprises lie in store...?
Our star!
Non vo' cantar!
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion,
Basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor,
Sharing in my triumph!
Angel, I hear you.
Speak, I listen.
Stay by my side,
Guide me.
Angel, my soul was weak,
Forgive me.
Enter at last, Master.
Flattering child, you shall know me.
See why in shadow I hide.
Look at your face in the mirror.
I am there, inside!
Angel of Music, guide and guardian,
Grant to me your glory.
Angel of Music, hide no longer.
Come to me, strange Angel.
I am your Angel of Music.
Come to me, Angel of Music.
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music
Christine! Christine!
Come to me, Angel of Music!
I am your angel of music!
Why have you brought me here?
We can't go back there!
We must return!
He'll kill you!
His eyes will find us there!
Christine, don't say that
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it
And if he has to kill a thousand men
Forget this waking nightmare
The Phantom of the Opera will kill
This phantom is a fable
...and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera
My God, who is this man
My God, who is this man
...who hunts to kill?
...this mask of death?
I can't escape from him
Whose is this voice you hear
...I never will!
...with every breath?
And in this labyrinth,
where light is blind
the Phantom of the Opera
is here/there
inside your/my mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul, I've been there, to his world of
unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolves
into darkness, darkness
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face,
in the darkness, darkness
But his voice filled my spirit
with a strange, sweet sound
In that night there was music in my mind
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before
What you heard was a dream and nothing more
Yet in his eyes all the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes, that both threaten and adore
Christine, Christine
Christine
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears.
Shamed into solitude
Shunned by the multitude
I learned to listen
In my dark, my heart heard music.
I longed to teach the world
Rise up and reach the world
No one would listen
I alone could hear the music
Then at last, a voice in the gloom
Seemed to cry "I hear you;
I hear your fears,
Your torment and your tears."
She saw my loneliness
Shared in my emptiness
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears...
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat! here the sacrifical lamb utters one dispairing bleat.
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets,
You will have to pay the bill- tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino faithful friend
Once again recite the plan
Your young guest believes I'm you,
I, the master, you the man.
When you met, you wore my cloak,
With my scarf you hid your face.
She believes she dines with me
In her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff,
Stealing what in truth is mine,
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine!
You come home!
I use your voice...
Slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say
Come hide with me!
Where oh where?
Of course, my room
Poor thing hasn't got a chance
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured
If I do not forget myself and laugh
No thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy
No dreams within her heart, but dreams of love
Master?
Passarino, go away, for the trap is set
and waits for his prey!
You have come here
In pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now has been silent...
Silent
I have brought you
That our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me, dropped all defenses
Completely succumbed to me Now you are here with me
No second thoughts
You've decided
Decided.
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
It scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
[sung]And he'll always be there,
singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there,
singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer
rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father
Friend or phantom
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper!
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze...
Wildly my mind beats against you...
You resist....
Phantom/Christine:
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Phantom/Christine:
Angel of Music,
You/I denied me/you!
Turning from true beauty!
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protecter!
Come to your/me strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me; Angel of Music....
No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you may (Draws sword) believe,
this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul! No. Not like this.
Now, let it be war upon you both.
I gave you my music, made your song take wing
And now, how you've repaid me, denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you, when he heard you sing, Christine
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning
You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you!
This trophy
From our saviors
From our saviors
From the enslaving force
Of Rome!
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration
We greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation
The trumpet of carthage resound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to our step on ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return
To find the land we love
Threatened once more
By Roma's far-reaching grasp
Gentlemen, gentlemen--
Rehearsals, as you can see, are underway for a new production on Chalumeau's Hannibal
Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing!
Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry
Ladies and gentlemen, please, if I could have your attention, thank you. As you know, for some weeks there have been rumors of my imminent retirement. I can now tell you that these are all true
ah-Ha!
(Continued) And it is my pleasure to introduce you to the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire: Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre. I'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the Junk business.
ANDRE: Scrap metal, actually.
MEG:(Whispering to Christine) They must be rich.
Monsieur Firmin:
And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron,
Monsieur Andre:
The Vicomte de Chagny
CHRISTINE: It's Raoul. Before my father died at the house by the seaI guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts. He called me Little Lotte.
MEG: Christine, he's so handsome.
Raoul:
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts, especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire.
Monsieur Lefevre:
Vicomte, gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons.
Voices/Piangi:
Brava! Brava!
Monsieur Lefevre:
Signor Ubaldo Piangi
Raoul:
An honor signor. I believe I am keeping you from your rehearsal. I will be here this evening to share your great triumph. My apologies, monsieur.
Monsieur Reyer:
Thank you, monsieur le Vicomte!
Once more if you please, signor
CARLOTTA
He love me. He love me. Love me, love me, love me.
CHRISTINE
He wouldn't recognize me.
MEG
He didn't see you.
GIRY
If you please, Monsieur.
(The ballet continues)
Madame Giry:
We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet, monsieur
Monsieur Andre:
I see why.
Especially that little blond angel.
Madame Giry:
My daughter, Meg Giry
Monsieur Firmin:
And that exceptional beauty
No relation, I trust?
Madame Giry:
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin,
Very promising.
Monsieur Andre:
Daae, did you say?
No relation to the Famous Swedish Violinist?
Madame Giry:
His only child.
Orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories.
Monsieur Firmin:
An orphan, you say?
(singing)
Chorus:
Hannibal's Friends!
The trumpeting elephant sound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to their step on the ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
All day!
All they want is the dancing!
Well, the Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala.
I hope he is as excited about dancing girls as your new managers,
Because I will not be singing!
What do we do?
Grovel
Grovel, grovel.
Right.
Principessa Bella Diva!
Si! Si! Si!
Goddess of song!
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa in Act. 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora--
Yes, Yes, But, NO!
Coz' I 'ave not my costume for Act. 3,
Coz' (shouting at someone) SOMEONE not finish it!
And I 'ate my hat
No, that's better
If my managers command!
Monsieur Reyer?
If my diva commands?
Yes, I do.
Twisted every way,
what answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life,
to win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought,
he murders all that's good . . .
I know I can't refuse
and yet, I wish I could . . .
Oh God - if I agree,
what horrors wait for me
in this, the Phantom's opera . . .?
Christine, Christine,
don't think that I don't care -
but every hope
and every prayer
rests on you now . . .
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame! Shame! Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame! Shame!! Shame!
Serafimo - your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
My love - I am called to England on affairs of State,
And must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool's leaving!
I suspect my young bride is untrue to me, I shall not leave but will hide over there.
To observe her.
Adieu, Adieu, Adieu.
Serafimo - away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha, Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here: the Phantom of the Opera ...
It's him I know it's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame? Perhaps it is you who are the toad ...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my ...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh -
Hahahahaha!
Croak, croak, croak, croak, croak, croak
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time ...
... when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Christine Daae.
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It was an accident ... simply an accident
Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lotte thought, Am I fonder of dolls
or of goblins or shoes?
Raoul
or of riddles of frocks
Those picnics in the attic
or of chocolates
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
No - what I love best, Lotte said,
is when I'm asleep in my bed
and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
You sang like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child
I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been
visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it - And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
RAOUL
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
CHRISTINE
Raoul, no
RAOUL
You must change. I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes - Little Lotte.
CHRISTINE
No, Raoul, wait!
PHANTOM
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion
basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor,
sharing in my triumph!
Angel! I hear you!
Speak, I listen...
stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak
forgive me...

Flattering child

Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music

Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music
Christine, Christine
Come to me: Angel of Music
Insolent boy!

of fashion
basking in your
glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave
young suitor,

Grant to me your
glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange
angel...

Come to me: Angel of Music ...
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness.
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you?
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion.
Never dream that out in the world there are arms to hold you.
You've always known: Your heart was on it's own.
So laugh in your lonelyness
Child of the wilderness.
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely.
Life can be lived, life can be loved alone
Sold. Your number, sir? Thank you. Lot 663, then, ladies and gentlemen. A poster from this house's production of Hannibal by Chalumau.

Your number sir? Lot 665 ladies and gentlemen. A papier mache musical box in the shape of a barrel organ. Attached, the figure of a monkey in persian robes playing the cymbals. This item, discovered in the vaults of the theatre, still in working order.
Showing here.
May I commence at 15 francs? 15, thank you. Yes 20 from you,sir. Thank you very much. Madame Giry 25. Thank you, Madame. 25 I'm bid. Do I hear 30? 30. And 35?
Selling at 30 francs then, 30 once, 30 twice. Sold, for 30 francs to the Vicomte de Chagny. Thank you, sir.
A collector's piece indeed... every detail exactly as she said... She often spoke of you, my friend... your velet lining and you figurine of lead... Will you still play, when all the rest of us are dead...?
Lot 666, then: a chandelier in pieces. Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained. We are told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster. Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light. Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago with a little illumination. Gentlemen!
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue — he will burn you with the heat of his eyes...
Madame Giry, wait. . .
Please, Monsieur - I know no more than
anyone else.
That's not true.
Please, Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents . . .
Accidents?! Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes . . .
Very well. It was years ago. There was a traveling
fair in the city. The gypsies. I was very young, studying to be a ballerina. One of many living in the dormitories of the opera house.
See the wonder from the East!
Cruel man. Come. Come. Come inside. Come and see The Devil's Child.
Cruel man. You damn demon! Villain! Ne'er do-well! Libertine! Dangerous! Hideous! Monstrous! BEAST! Murder!
Which way?!
That way! That way!
He's getting away!
I hid him from the world, and its cruelties.
Young Giry. If you stay in here, you are safe.
Young Erik. Thank you so much, young lady.
He has known nothing else of life since then except this opera house. I called him Erik. It was his playground and now his artistic domain, he's a genius. He's an architect and designer, he's composer and a magician. A genius, Monsieur!
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness.
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed
Well, one does one's best
Here's to us
I must say all the same, that it's a shame
That Phantom fellow isn't here
Bravo, Monsieur! You've figured out my secret! Such spirited words!
Phantom: Let's see, Monsieur, how fare you dare go!
Stay back!
That's right, that's right, Monsieur! Keep fighting this way! 
You can't win her love by making her your prisoner! Leave her alone!
I'm here, I'm here, Monsieur: The Angel of Death! C'mon, c'mon, Monsieur, don't stop! Don't stop! Keep fighting! Swing at me, Monsieur!
Raoul!
And now, Monsieur! You shall die.
Now we end this!
No, Raoul... no! Not like this.
DON'T GO!
Now let it be war upon you both!
Child of the Wilderness, dying in loneliness.
I can hear you,
I can feel your every fear.
I never dreamed out in this opera, there was someone who loved me.
I've always known, my heart wasn't alone.
I've felt your emptiness, and your loneliness.
My Fallen Angel,
I can feel your kiss still linger here.
My Fallen Angel,
you still remain, a lover in my heart.
