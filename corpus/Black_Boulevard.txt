            JOE (V.O.)
I guess it was five a.m.
A homicide had been reported
From one of those crazy mansions up on Sunset
Tomorrow every front page
Is going to lead with this story
You see an old time movie star is involved
Maybe the biggest star of all

But before you read about it
Before it gets distorted
By those Hollywood piranhas
If you wanna know the real facts
You've come to the right party

Let me take you back six months
I was at the bottom of the barrel
I'd had a contract down at Fox
But I'd fallen foul of Darryl
Now I had a date at Paramount
Along with about a thousand other writers
If it didn't come up roses
I'd be covering funerals
Back in Dayton, Ohio

I'd hidden my car three blocks away
Turned out to be a smart move.

Hi there, Myron

How's it hanging?

I've got a date with Sheldrake

I'm shooting a Western down at Fox

How can you work with Darryl?

We should talk

Gotta run

Let's have lunch

Hi, Mr. Gillis

You look great!

I'm up for an audition

Sheldrake is driving me insane

Don't forget me when you're casting

We should talk

Gotta run

Let's have lunch


Morning, Joanna   Hi there, Myron

Who are you meeting?   You look great

Sheldrake, but do I need it?   I've spent the last month fasting

I'm handing in my second draft   I'm shooting a Western down at Fox

I'd really love to read it   Don't forget me when you're casting

We should talk   We should talk

Gotta run   Gotta run

Let's have lunch   Let's have lunch


Yeah, I have an appointment with Mr. Sheldrake.

Name?

Gillis. Joseph Gillis.

All right, sir, you know your way?

Yeah.

We want the keys to your car

You're way behind with the payments

Don't give us any fancy footwork...

Give us the keys.

I only wish I could help
I loaned it to my accountant
He has an important client down in Palm Springs
Felt like shooting the breeze

Are you telling us you walked here?

I believe in self-denial
I'm in training for the priesthood

O.K., wise guy, three hundred bucks.

Or we're taking the car.

We have a court order.

I love it when you talk dirty.

Bless you, Joseph

That you, Sammy?

How do you like my harem?

How come you get such lousy breaks?

One learns to grin and bear 'em

This is the biggest film ever made.

What're you playing?

Temple virgin

Handmaiden to Delilah

Let's have lunch
Gotta run

You've got to find me a job
I'm way behind with my payments
I thought you were meant to be my agent
I need some work

I only wish I could help
This town is dead at the moment
There's been this slowdown in production...

Who is this jerk?

He's my wunderkid from Broadway
Every major studio wants him

Playing one against the other...

What I need is three hundred bucks

Maybe what you need is a new agent.

Hello, Artie

Joe, you bastard!

You never call me any more

Found a cuter dancing partner
How are things?

Not so great

Will this help?
Twenty bucks?

Thanks, you're a pal.

Good morning, Mr. DeMille.

Good morning, C.B.

This is Sheldrake
Bring some water
Get me that shithead Nolan

Nolan, sweetheart
Great to talk
This draft is so much brighter
You're the best
Even so
I've hired another writer

Mr. Gillis.

Joe! What the fuck brings you here?

You wanted to see me.

I did? What about?

"Bases Loaded." It's an outline for a baseball picture.

So, pitch.

It's about a rookie shortstop. He's batting .347.
The kid was once mixed up in a holdup. Now he's trying to go straight.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I have read this.
Somebody, bring in what we've got on...

"Bases Loaded."

..."Bases Loaded."

They're pretty hot for it over at Twentieth.

Good!

But can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?

Let's have lunch

Here's that "Bases Loaded" materical, Mr. Sheldrake.
I made a two-page synopsis for you, but I wouldn't bother to read it.

Why not?

It's just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.

Meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.

We should talk

This is Miss Kramer.

Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now, I'd like to crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.

If I could be of any help...

I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, I couldn't see the point of it.

What sort of material do you suggest? James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?

I think pictures should at least try to say a little something.

I see you're one of the message kids.
I expect you'd have turned down "Gone With the Wind".

No, that was me.

Gotta run

And I guess I was disappointed.
I've read some of your other work and I thought you had some real talent.

Yeah, that was last year. This year I felt like eating.

Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis.

Thank you, Miss Kramer.
Well, looks like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.

We should talk
Gotta run
Let's have lunch

You've got to give me some work
I'll take whatever's on offer
There must be some shit that needs a rewrite
Throw it my way

I only wish I could help
There's no spare shit at the moment
Remember the greatest writers starved in Garrets
Didn't care about pay

Are you trying to be funny?

I believe in self-denial
Gives a man some moral backbone

Can you loan me three hundred bucks?

I'm sorry, Gillis. Good-bye.

I just love Hollywood.

            JOE
Come to get your knife back?
It's still right there, right between my shoulder blades.

I read
One of your stories
Wasn't it Scribner's
Some magazine.
Title -
Something with windows.

It was "Blind Windows
If that's what you mean

That's right
I really liked it

I'm all warm and runny inside

Let me pitch it to Sheldrake

I may be broke
But I still have my pride

Come on.
Get off your high horse
Writers with pride don't live in L.A.
Silence
Exile and cunning
Those are the only cards you can play

Sheldrake won't buy this story
He likes trash with fairy lights
Jesus, think of the effort
Trying to get him to heighten his sights

Every movie's a circus
Can't we discuss this
Schwab's Thursday night?

What for?
Nothing will happen
I gotta go now
Fight the good fight

What's the rush?

See those gorillas?

Yes, what about them?

Do me a terrific favour
Keep them amused while I escape

If you're at Schwab's on Thursday

Done. Look, those guys are after my car.
If I lose that in this town, it's like having my legs cut off.

Let's duck into the soundstage.

Come on, Gillis, give us the keys.

Shhh! Please be quiet, Mr. DeMille is shooting right over there.

So what?

He's working on "Samson and Delilah": they're doing a red-hot scene with Hedy Lamarr.
You want to stay and watch?

No.

Relax, we got five minutes.

Hey, hey, come back here...

            At The House On Sunset       
            The sound of heavy rain. It's day-time but dull enough to need the lights on.
JOE's typewriter is no longer on the table, but closed and standing on end on the floor.
HE's alone in the great room, playing solitaire.
MAX is at the organ, wearing his white gloves, playing.
HE looks up at the audience, breaks off from his game.

In December, the rains came.
One great big package, over-sized, like everything else in California;
and it came right through the roof of my room above the garage.
So she had me moved into the main house.
Into what Max called " The room of the husbands."
And on a clear day, the theory was, you could see Catalina.
And little by little I worked through to the end of the script.
At which point I might have left;
Only by then those two boys from the finance company had traced my car and towed it away;
and I hadn't seen one single dollar of cash money since I arrived.

(HE resumes his game;
all of a sudden NORMA sweeps out of her room and down the stairs.
SHE's holding a fat typescript in her hand. SHE snaps at MAX.)

Stop that!

(MAX stops playing.)

Today's the day.

What do you mean?

Max is going to deliver the script to Paramount.

You're really going to give it to De Mille?

I've just spoken with my astrologer.
She read De Millle's horoscope; she read mine.

Did she read the script?

De Mille is Leo; I'm Scorpio.
Mars is transiting Jupiter, and today is the day of closest conjunction.

Oh, well, that's all right, then.

Max

Yes, Madame

(SHE hands the typescript to MAX.)

Make sure it goes to Mr. De Mille in person.

(HE leaves the house by the front door. There's a silence;
NORMA moves up and down in a state of heightened emotion;
JOE is steeling himself to broach a difficult subject.)

Well....

Great day.

It's been real interesting.

Yes... hasn't it?

I want to thank you for trusting me with your baby.

Not at all, it is I who should thank you.

Will you call and let me know as soon as you have some news?

(NORMA frowns; SHE turns to him, her expression bewildered.)

Call? Where?

My apartment.

Oh, but, you couldn't possibly think of leaving now, Joe.

Norma, the script is finished.

No, Joe. No. It's just the beginning,
it's just the first draft: I couldn't dream of letting you go, I need your support.

Well, I can't stay.

You'll stay on with full salary, of course...

Oh, Norma, it's not the money.

(NORMA now has a look of genuine panic on her face,
and JOE sees that some reassurance is essential.)

Yes, of course, I'll stay until we get some sort of news back from Paramount.

(HE's on his feet now, and NORMA grips his hand tightly for a moment.)

Thank you, thank you, Joe.

(SHE releases his hand and moves off leaving him a little shaken by this turn of events,
his expression rueful. HE turns to the audience.)

So, Max wheeled out that foreign bus
brushed the leopardskin upholstery.
He trundled along to Paramount
to hand Cecil B. our hopeless opus.
My work was over
I was feeling no pain
locked up like John the Baptist.

No more wars to fight
White flags fly tonight
You are out of danger now
Battlefield is still
Wild poppies on the hill
Peace can only come when you surrender

Here the tracers fly
Lighting up the sky
But I'll fight on to the end
Let them send their armies
I will never bend
I won't see you now 'til I surrender
I'll see you again when I surrender

Now don't you give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.

Look, lady, you've got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with my car, I just pulled into your driveway.

Get out.

O.K. And I'm sorry you lost your friend.

Get out of here.

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

Or shall I call my servant?

Aren't you Norma Desmond? You used to be in pictures.
You used to be big.

I am big. It's the pictures that got small.

Once upon a time
Not long ago
The head of any studio
Knew how and when to play his aces
Now they put some
Talentless unknown
Beneath their sacred microphone
We didn't need words
We had faces

Yes, they took all the idols and smashed them
The Fairbanks, the Gilberts, the Valentinos
They trampled on what was divine
They threw away the gold of silence
When all they needed was this face of mine

Hey! Don't blame me, I'm just a writer.

With one look you'll know all you need to know

With one smile I'm the girl next door
Or the love that you've hungered for
When I speak it's with my soul
I can play any role

No words can tell the stories my eyes tell
Watch me when I frown, you can't write that down
You know I'm right, it's there in black and white
When I look your way, you'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look I put words to shame
Just one look sets the screen aflame
Silent music starts to play
One tear in my eye makes the whole world cry

With one look they'll forgive the past
They'll rejoice I've returned at last
To my people in the dark
Still out there in the dark...

Silent music starts to play
With one look you'll know all you need to know

With one look I'll ignite a blaze
I'll return to my glory days
They'll say, "Norma's back at last!

This time I am staying, I'm staying for good
I'll be back to where I was born to be
With one look I'll be me!

Now go.

Next time I'll bring my autograph album.

Just a minute, you.
Did you say you were a writer?

That's what it says on my guild card.

And you're written pictures?

Sure have. Would you like to see my credits?

Come over here. I want to ask you something.
Just what sort of length is a movie script these days?

Depends.

I wrote this. It's a very important picture.

Look like six very important pictures.

It's for DeMille to direct.

Oh, yeah? And will you be in it?

Of course. What do you think?

Just asking. I didn't know you were planning a comeback.

I hate that word. It's a return.

Well...fair enough.

I want you to read it.

You shouldn't let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.

I'm not afraid. Sit down. Max!
Bring something to drink.

Yes, Madame.

I said sit down!
It's about Salome.
Salome: the story of a woman. The woman who was all women.

Salome, what a woman, what a part!
Innocent body and a sinful heart
Inflaming Herod's lust
But secretly loving a holy man
No one could play her like I can

Well, I had nothing urgent coming up
I thought I might as well skim it
It's fun to see how bad bad writing can be
This promised to go to the limit

There's so many great scenes, I can't wait
A boiling cauldron of love and hate
She toys with Herod
'Til he's putty in her hands
He reels tormented through the desert sands

It sure was a real cheery set-up
The wind wheezing through that organ
Max shuffling around and a dead ape dumped on a shelf
And her staring like a gorgon

They drag the Baptist up from the jails
She dances the dance of the seven veils
Herod says: I'll give you anything

Now it was time for some comedy relief
The guy with the baby casket
Must have seen a thing or two, that chimp
Shame it was too late to ask it

Have you got to the scene where asks for his head?
If she can't have him living
She'll take him dead
They bring in his head on a silver tray
She kisses his mouth. It's a great screenplay!

It got to be eleven, I was feeling ill
What the hell was I doing?
Melodrama and sweet champagne
And a garbled plot from a scrambled brain
But I had my own plot brewing

Just how old is Salome?

Sixteen.

I see.

Well?

It's fascinating.

Of course it is.

Could be it's a little long
Maybe the opening's wrong
But it's extremely good for a beginner

No, it's a perfect start
I wrote that with my heart
The river-bank, the baptist and the sinner

Shouldn't there be some dialogue?

I can say anything I want with my eyes

It could use a few cuts

I will not have it butchered!

I'm not talking limb from limb
I just mean a little trim
All you need is someone who can edit

I want someone with a knack
Not just any studio hack
And don't think for a moment I'd share credit!

When were you born?

December 21st, why?

I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.

Thanks.

I want you to do this work.

Me? Gee, I don't know, I'm busy. I just finished one script and I'm about to start a new assignment.

I don't care.

I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.

Don't you worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.

Well, it's getting kind of late.

Are you married, Mr...?

The name is Gillis. Single.

Where do you live?

Hollywood. Alto Nido Apartments.

You'll stay here.

I'll come back early tomorrow.

Nonsense, there's a room over the garage. Max will take you there. Max!

Yes, Madame.

Take Mr. Gillis to the guest room.
We'll begin a nine sharp.

Now this is more like it.

I made up the bed this afternoon.

Thanks.
How did you know I was going to stay?

There's soap and a toothbrush in the bathroom.

            The Greatest Star Of All       
            MAX
Once, you won't remember
If you said Hollywood, hers was the face you'd think of
Her face on every billboard
In just a single week, she's get ten thousand letters

Men would offer
Fortunes for a bloom from her corsage
Or a few strands of her hair

Today, she's half-forgotten
But it's the pictures that got small
She is the greatest star of all

Then, you can't imagine
How fans would sacrifice themselves to touch her shadow
There was a maharajah
Who hanged himself with one of her discarded stockings

She's immortal
Caught inside that flickering light beam
Is a youth which cannot fade

Madame's a living legend;
I've seen so many idols fall
She is the greatest star of all

When he'd gone, I stook looking out the window for a while.
There was the ghost of a tennis court with faded markings and a sagging net.
There was an empty pool where Clara Bows and Fatty Arbuckle must have swum 10,000 midnights ago.
And then there was something else: the chimp's last rites, as if she were laying
a child to rest. Was her life really as empty as that?

I just want to throw them on the next train home

Never thought
You'd be so condescending

Sorry, Miss Schaefer
I didn't come here to fight

Girl meets boy
If that's how you want it
She's a young teacher
He's a reporter
It's hate at first sight

It won't sell
These days they want glamour
Fabulous heiress meets handsome Hollywood heel
The problem is
She thinks he's a burglar
Would you believe it?
A wedding in the last reel

It doesn't have to be so mindless
You should write from your experience
Give us something really moving;
Something true

Who wants true?
Who the hell wants moving?
Moving means starving
And true means holes in your shoe

No, you're wrong
They still make good pictures
Stick to your story
It's a good story

O.K., Miss Schaefer:
I give it to you

What do you mean?

Just what I said. I've given up writing myself. So you write it.

Oh, I'm not good enough to do it on my own.
But I thought we could write it together.

I can't. I'm all tied up.

Couldn't we work evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? I'd come to your place.

Look, Betty, it can't be done. It's out.
Let's keep in touch through Artie.
That way if you get stuck, we can at least talk.

Write this down
I'll give you some ground rules
Plenty of conflict
But nice guys don't break the law
Girl meets boy
She gives herself completely
And though she loves him

She keeps one foot on the floor

No one dies except the best friend
No one ever mentions communists
No one takes a black friend to a restaurant

Very good.
Nothing I can teach you.
We could have had fun
Fighting the studio

Yes, Mr. Gillis
That's just what I want.

What a nightmare
Good to see you
Come to my new year's party

Last year it got out of hand

Guaranteed bad behaviour

See you then

Don't give up
You're too good

Thanks.

            MAX
Where have you been?

Out. I assume I can go out when I feel like it.

Madame is quite agitated.
Earlier this evening, she wanted you for something and you could not be found.

Well, that's tough.

I don't think you understand, Mr. Gillis. Madame is extremely fragile.
She has moments of melancholy. There have been suicide attempts.

Why? Because of her career? She's done well enough.
Look at all the fan mail she gets every day.

I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks if I were you.

You mean you write them?

Will you be requiring some supper this evening, sir?

No. And Max?

Yes, sir?

Who the hell do you think you are,
bringing my stuff up from my apartment without consulting me?
I have a life of my own - now you're telling me I'm supposed to be a prisoner here.

I think, perhaps, sir, you will have to make up your mind to abide by the rules of this house.
That is, if you want the job.

I started work on the script
I hacked my way through the thicket
A maze of fragmented ramblings
By a soul in limbo
She hovered there like a hawk
Afraid I'd damage her baby

What's that?

I thought we might cut away from the slave market...

Cut away from me?

Norma, they don't want you in every scene

Or course they do. What else would they have come for?
Put it back.

I'd made my first big mistake
I'd put my foot in the quicksand
It wouldn't be a few days
Paste and scissors
This would take weeks

The house was always so quiet
Just me and Max and that organ
No one phoned and nobody ever came
And there was only one kind
of entertainment on hand

Max, what's on this evening?
I hope it's not one of her weepy melodramas

We'll be showing
One of Madam's enduring classics
"The Ordeal of Joan of Arc"

Oh, God.
We saw that last week.

A masterpiece can never pall
She is the greatest star of all

            NORMA
This was dawn
There were no rules
We were so young
Movies were born
So many songs
Yet to be sung
So many roads
Still unexplored
We gave the world
New ways to dream
Somehow we found
New ways to dream

Joan of Arc:
Look at my face
Isn't it strong?
There in the dark
Up on the screen
Where I belong

We'll show them all
Nothing has changed
We'll give the world
New ways to dream
Everyone needs
New ways to dream

I didn't argue, why hurt her?
You don't yell at a sleepwalker
Or she could fall and break her neck
She smelled of faded roses
It made me sad to watch her
As she relived her glory
Poor Norma
So happy
Lost in her silver heaven

Nothing has changed
We'll give the world
New ways to dream
Everyone needs

            Completion Of The Script       
            JOE
In December, the rains came. One great big package, over-sized,
just like everything else in California;
and it came right through the roof of my room above the garage.
So she had me moved into the main house.
Into what Max called "the room of the husbands".
And on a clear day, the theory was, you could see Catalina.
And little by little I worked through to the end of the script.
At which point I might have left:
only by then those two boys from the finance company had traced my car and towed it away,
and I hadn't seen one single dollar of cash money since I arrived.

Stop that!
Today's the day.

What do you mean?

Max is going to deliver the script to Paramount.

You're really going to give it to DeMille?

I've just spoken with my astrologer. She read DeMille's horoscope; she read mine.

Did she read the script?

DeMille is Leo; I'm Scorpio.
Mars is transiting Jupiter and today is the day of closest conjunction.

Oh well, that's all right, then.

Max.

Yes, Madame.

Make sure it goes to Mr. DeMille in person.

Well...

Great day.

It's been real interesting.

Yes...hasn't it?

I want to thank you for trusting me with your baby.

Not at all, it is I who should thank you.

Will you call and let me know as soon as you have some news?

Call? Where?

My apartment.

Oh, but you couldn't possibly think of leaving now, Joe.

Norma, the script is finished.

No, Joe. No. It's just the beginning, it's just the firt draft.
I couldn't dream of letting you go, I need your support.

Well, I can't stay.

You'll stay on with full salary, of course...

Oh, Norma, it's not the money
Yes, of course, I'll stay until we get some sort of news back from Paramount.

Thank you. Thank you, Joe.

So, Max wheeled out that foreign bus
Brushed the leopardskin upholstery
He trundled along to Paramount
To hand Cecil B. our hopeless opus
My work was over
I was feeling no pain
Locked up like John the Baptist

Hurry up, the birthday boy is on his way
This is a surprise celebration
I hope you've remembered everything I've said
I want to see a total transformation

What's all this?

Happy birthday, darling. Did you think we'd forgotten?

Well, I ... I don't know.

These people are from the best men's shop in town. I had them close it down for the day.

Norma, now listen!

I'll leave you boys to it.

Happy birthday, welcome to your shopathon!

What's going on?

Help yourself, it's all been taken care of
Anyone who's anyone is dressed by me

Well, golly gee

Pick out anything you'd like a pair of
You just point, I'll do the rest
I've brought nothing but the best
You're a very lucky writer
Come along now, get undressed
Unless I'm much mistaken
That's a 42-inch chest

I don't understand a word you're saying

Well, all you need to know's the lady's paying
It's nice to get your just reward this time of year

Get outta here!

And all my merchandise is strictly kosher
When you've thrown away all your old worn-out stuff

Hey, that's enough

Perhaps you'd like to model for my brochure
I have just the thing for you
Chalk-stripe suits

In black

Or blue

Glen plaid trousers

Cashmere sweaters

Bathing shorts for Malibu

Here's a patent leather lace-up

It's a virtuoso shoe

And a simply marvelous coat made of vicuna

You know what you can do with your vicuna

Come on Joe, you haven't even started yet

You wanna bet?

I thought by now he'd look the height of fashion
He always takes forever making up his mind
Don't be unkind
I thought you writers knew about compassion

I love flannel on a man

This will complement his tan

We'll take two of these and four of those

I'm still your greatest fan!
Very soon now we'll have stopped him
Looking like an also-ran

You're going to make me sorry that I'm staying

Well, all right, I'll choose, after all, I'm paying!

Evening clothes?

I want to see your most deluxe

Won't wear a tux

Of course not, dear, tuxedos are for waiters

What we need are tails, a white tie and top hat

I can't wear that

Joe, second-rate clothes are for second-raters

Norma, please...

Shut up, I'm rich
Now some platinum blonde bitch
I own so many apartments
I've forgotten which is which

I don't have to go to premieres
I'm never on display
You seem to forget that I'm a writer
Who cares what you wear when you're a writer?

I care, Joe, and please don't be so mean to me.

O.K., all right.

You can't come to my New Year's Eve party in that filling-station shirt.

I've been invited somewhere else on New Year's Eve.

Where?

Artie Green. He's an old friend of mine.

I can't do without you, Joe, I need you.
I've sent out every single invitation

All right, Norma, I give in

Of course you do
And when they've dressed you
You'll cause a sensation

We equip the chosen few of Movieland

(The latest cut)

We dress every movie star and crooner
From their shiny toecaps to their hatband

(Conceal your gut)
You won't regret selecting the vicuna

If you need a hand to shake
If there's a girl you want to make
If there's a soul you're out to capture
Or a heart you want to break
If you want the world to love you

You'll have to learn to take

And gracefully accept the role you're playing

You will earn every cent the lady's paying

So why not have it all?

Now that didn't hurt, did it?

The lady's paying!

Or shall I open the champage

Who's she invited to the ball?

Madame herself made every call

Here. Happy New Year.

Norma, I can't take this.

Oh, shut up. Open it. Read what it says.

"Mad about the boy".

Yes; and you do look absolutely divine.

Well, thank you.

I had these tiles put in, you know,
because Rudy Valentino said to me, it takes tiles to tango. Come on.

No, no, not on the same floor as Valentino!

Oh come on, come on, come on. Get up. Follow me.
And one, two... and one, two, one two, together. And one.
Don't lean back like that.

Ring out the old
Ring in the new
A midnight wish
To share with you
Your lips are warm
My head is light
Were we alive before tonight?

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I want is here
If you're with me
Next year will be
The perfect year

Before we play
Some dangerous game
Before we fan
Some harmless flame
We have to ask if this is wise
And if the game is worth the prize

With this wine and with this music
How can anything be clear?
Let's wait and see
It may just be
The perfect year

It's New Year's Eve
And hopes are high
Dance one year in
Kiss one goodbye
Another chance, another start
So many dreams to tease the heart

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything we want is here
And face to face
We will embrace
The perfect year

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything we want is here
And face to face
We will embrace

The other guests.

There are no other guests. Just you and me.
I'm in love with you. Surely you know that

Norma...

We'll have a wonderful time next year. I'll have the pool filled up for you.
I'll open up my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean.
I have enough money to buy us anything we want.

Cut out that "us" business.

What's the matter with you?

What right do you have to take me for granted?

What right? Do you want me to tell you?

Norma, what I am trying to say is that I am the wrong guy for you.
You need a big shot, someone with polo ponies, a Valentino...

What you're trying to say is, you don't want me to love you. Say it! Say it!

Max. Get me a taxi.

I had to get out
I needed to be with people my own age
To hear the sound of laughter
And mix with hungry actors
Underemployed composers
Nicotine-poisoned writers
Real people
Real problems
Having a really good time

Hey, Gillis! We'd give you up.
Let me take your coat
Jesus, Joe, what's this made of? Mink?
Who did you borrow this from? Adolphe Menjou?

Close, but no cigar.
Hey! It's quite a crowd

I invited all the kids doing walk-ons in "Samson and Delilah".

Where have you been hiding? I called your apartment.
I called your ex-agent. I was about to call the Bureau of Missing Persons.

Well, they always know where to find me.

Hey, Sammy!
You gotta say your New Year's resolution out loud
Jean!

By this time next year
I'll have landed a juicy part

Nineteen fifty will be my start

No more carrying spears

I'll be discovered
My life won't ever be the same
Billy Wilder will know my name
And he'll call all the time

'Til he does, can one of you guys lend her a dime?

Just an apartment
With no roaches and no dry rot

Where the hot water comes out hot

That's my Hollywood dream

Your resolution

Is to write something that gets shot
With approximately the plot
I first had in my head

But you'll get rewritten even after you're dead

Artie!

It's the year to begin a new life
Buy a place somewhere quiet, somewhere pretty
When you have a young kid and a wife
Then you need somewhere green, far from the city
It's a rambling old house with a big apple tree
With a swing for the kid and a hammock for me

Behold, my children
It is I, Cecil B. DeMille
Meeting me must be quite a thrill

But there's no need to kneel

I guarantee you
Every girl in my chorus line
Is a genuine Philistine

They don't come off the shelf

I flew every one in from Philistia myself

I have some good news
It's "Blind Windows"

You don't let go

I gave Sheldrake an outline, Joe
And he swallowed the bait

Well, hallelujah!

While you've been buying vicuna coats
I've been making a lot of notes
Now there's work we should do...

Betty, you're forgetting that I gave it to you
You remind me of me long ago
Off the bus, full of ignorant ambition
Thought I'd waltz into some studio
And achieve overnight recognition
I've seen too many optimists sinking like stones
Felt them suck all the marrow clean out of my bones

I love "Blind Windows
But I can't write it on my own
Can't we speak on the telephone?
All my evenings are free

Hey, just a minute
I'm the fellow who bought the ring

Artie, this is a business thing
It's important to me
You'll be on location in Clinch, Tennessee
Please make this your New Year's resolution for me

By this time next year
I will get my foot in the door
Next year I know I'm going to score
An amazing success

Cut to the moment
When they open the envelope
Pass the statuette to Bob Hope
And it's my name you hear

We'll be down on our knees
Outside Grauman's Chinese
Palm prints there on the street
Immortality's neat!
This time next year
This time next year

We'll have nothing to fear
Contracts all signed
Three-picture deal
Yellow brick road career
Hope we're not still saying these things
This time next year

You know, I think I will be available in the New Year. In fact, I'm available right now.

Joe, that's great!

Hey, Artie, where's your phone?

Under the bar.

Hey, Artie. You think you could put me up for a couple of weeks?

It just so happens we've got a vacancy on the couch.

I'll take it.

Yes?

Max, it's Mr. Gillis. I want you to do me a favour.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis. I can't talk right now.

Listen, I want you to take my old suitcases...

I'm sorry, I am attending to Madame.

What do you mean?

Madame found the razor in your room. And she's cut her wrists.

Three, two, one, Happy New Year!

Sure I came out here to make my name
Wanted my pool, my dose of fame
Wanted my parking space at Warner's
But after a year, a one room hell
A murphy bed, a rancid smell
Wallpaper peeling at the corners

Sunset Boulevard, twisting boulevard
Secretive and rich, a little scary
Sunset Boulevard, tempting boulevard
Waiting there to swallow the unwary

Dreams are not enough to win a war
Out here they're always keeping score
Beneath the tan the battle rages
Smile a rented smile, fill someone's glass
Kiss someone's wife, kiss someone's ass
We do whatever pays the wages

Sunset Boulevard, headline boulevard
Getting here is only the beginning
Sunset Boulevard, jackpot boulevard
Once you've won you have to go on winning

You think I've sold out?
Dead right I've sold out!
I just keep waiting for the right offer
Comfortable quarters, regular rations
24-hour Five Star room service
And if I'm honest, I like the lady
I can't help being touched by her folly
I'm treading water, taking the money
Watching her sun set... Well, I'm a writer!

L.A.'s changed a lot over the years
Since those brave gold rush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons
Far as they could go end of the line
Their dreams were yours, their dreams were mine
But in those dreams were hidden dragons

Sunset Boulevard, frenzied boulevard
Swamped with every kind of false emotion
Sunset Boulevard, brutal boulevard
Just like you, we'll wind up in the ocean

She was sinking fast, I threw a rope
Now I have suits and she has hope
It seemed an elegant solution
One day this must end, it isn't real
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal
Before tomorrrow's execution

Sunset Boulevard, ruthless boulevard
Destination for the stony-hearted
Sunset Boulevard, lethal boulevard
Everyone's forgotten how they started
Here on Sunset Boulevard...!

She dressed up like a pharaoh
Slapped on a pound of make-up

So happy
Re-entering her kingdom

If you will pardon me, Madame, the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.

Hello, Mr. DeMille.
The last time I saw you, we were someplace terribly gay. I was dancing on the table.

A lot of people were. Lindbergh had just landed.

You read the script, of course.

Well, yes...

Now, I know how busy you are during shooting,
but I really think you could have picked up the phone yourself,
instead of leaving it so some assistant.

Yes, you do.

I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted seas, the sound here...
Yes, a world to rediscover
But I 'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now, you can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy tale adventure
In this ever spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the cameras will start turning...
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone
That's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it...
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment
With so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always...
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye...
We taught the world new ways to dream!

            Paramount Conversations       
            (The Isotta-Fraschini turns off Brobnson and pulls up in front of the main gates.
For the moment, nothing happens; but MAX , it emerges, is engaged in important business,
staring fixedly into the rear view mirror.)

If you will pardon me, Madame, the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.

Thank you, Max.

(She attends to it, using a handkerchief. Meanwhile, MAX sounds the horn impatiently.
A young STUDIO GUARD breaks off a conversation
HE's been having with an EXTRA dressed as an indian brave.)

Hey, that's enough of that.

To see Mr. DeMille. Open the gate.

Mr. DeMille is shooting. You need an appointment.

This is Norma Desmond. No appointment is necessary.

Norma who?

(Meanwhile, however, NORMA has recognized JONES,
who is sifting on a wooden chair, reading a newspaper. She rolls down the window.)

Jonesy!


(JONES looks up, frowning; then his expression clears and he approaches the car.)

Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond. How have you been, Miss Desmond?

Fine, Jonesy. Open the gate.

(JONES turns tohis young COLLEAGUE.)

You heard Miss Desmond.

They don't have a pass.

(JONES shakes his head, exasperated, and begins to open the gate himself.
The car moves forward.)

Stage 18, Miss Desmond.

Thank you, Jonesy. And teach your friend some manners.
Tell him without me there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.

(As the car glides through the gates, JONES picks up his telephone.)

Get me Stage 18. I have a message for Mr. DeMille.

(A scene-change reveals the cavernous exterior of Sound Stage 18,
where the STAND-INS for Victor Mature and Hedy Lamaar are in position, in a blaze of light,
on the grandiose "Samson and Delilah" set. MR. DEMILLE,
recognizable from the parody version of Act I, confers with his DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY.
HE's interrupted by one of his assistants, HEATHER, who approaches with some trepidation.)

Mr. DeMille?

What is it?

Norma Desmond is here to see you, Mr. DeMille.

Norma Desmond?

She's here at the studio.

It must be about that appalling script of hers. What shall I say?

Maybe I could give her the brush.

Thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? Give me a minute.

(He turns towards the set.

Meanwhile, NORMA has arrived outside the studio with MAX and JOE.
She hesitates for a moment, gripping JOE's hand fiercely.)

Won't you come along, darling?

(JOE shakes his head.)

It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.


Thank you, darling.

(By this time, HEATHER has emerged from the studio. She comes over to greet NORMA.)

Miss Desmond.

(She leads NORMA towards the studio. DE MILLE is waiting just inside; he envelops her in his arms.)

Well, well, well.

Hello, Mr. DeMille.

(A long embrace.)

Last time I saw you was some place terribly gay. I was dancing on a table.

A lot of people were. Lindbergh had lust landed.

(He starts to lead her into the studio.)

You read the script, of course.

Well, yes...

I know how busy you are when you're shooting,
but I really think you could have picked up the phone yourself, instead of leaving it to some assistant.

I don't know what you mean, Norma.

Yes, you do.

Come on in.

(HE leads her into the studio, a bewildering chaos of sound and activity, which at first stuns her.
HE shouts to be heard above the cacophony.
He hurries off. Slowly, as NORMA looks around, the sound fades to nothing.
She stands there, looking around the old familiar space. Suddenly, a VOICE rings out.)

Miss Desmond! Hey, Miss Desmond!

(NORMA looks around, unable to identify the source of the VOICE)

Up here, Miss Desmond; it's Hog-eye!

(NORMA looks up. Up in the flies, balanced on the walkway, is a quite elderly ELECTRICIAN.)

Hog-eye! Well, hello!

Let's get a look at you.

(And so saying, HE swivels one of the big lamps until it finds her.
SHE stands for a moment, isolated, bathed in the light.
Then, from all over the studio, murmuring among themselves, TECHNICIANS, EXTRAS
and STAGEHANDS begin to converge on her.)

I don't know why I'm frightened,
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees,
The painted seas,
The sound here.

Yes, a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment.

The whispered conversations
In overcrowded hallways,
The atmosphere
As thrilling here
As always.

Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye.

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how
I've missed you,

Missed the fairy-tale adventures
In this ever-spinning playground,
We were young together.

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until
The cameras will
Start turning.

Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye.

I don't want to be alone
That's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last.

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly
We all know I
Can do it.

Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment
With so much to live for?

The whispered conversations
In overcrowded hallways,
So much to say
Not just today
But always

We?ll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything?s as if we never said goodbye.
Yes, everything?s as if we never said goodbye.

We taught the world new ways to dream.

(The focus shifts to outside the studio, where JOE has moved off to lean against a wall,
smoke a cigarette, and enjoy the passing parade. Suddenly, HE sees BETTY hurrying past,
a bundle of scripts under her arm. HE thinks about avoiding HER altogether,
but she's seen him and bears down on him.)

Well, hello,
Mr. Gillis.
Where have you been
Keeping yourself?

Someone's
Been doing it for me.

And meanwhile "Blind Windows
Is stuck on the shelf.
You said
We'd work together.

New Year's crisis
What can I say?

Always
Full of excuses.

Promise I'll call you
Later today.

(BETTY looks at HIM for a moment.)

You said that last time.

Betty, I won't let you down.

I guess I'll just have to trust you.

(BETTY smiles at him and hurries on.

During this exchange, SHELDRAKE has entered. HE stops having caught sight of the Isotta.
HE tries to catch MAX?s attention, but MAX deliberately ignores him. Finally,
SHELDRAKE plants himself unavoidably in front of him.)

You're Miss Desmond?s German shepherd.
I'm the one who's been calling.

The name is Sheldrake, A couple of weeks ago, I was looking out of my office window
and I saw you driving on to the lot. And I said that's exactly the car I've been looking for.
Great for my new Crosby picture. So, I made some inquiries and I've been calling for two weeks.
Doesn?t she ever answer the phone? It's so perfect.
You can't find that kind of quality outside of a museum.
We?re willing to pay a hundred dollars a week...

It's outrageous,
You insult her,
How can you be so cruel?
I forbid you to approach her.

You're insane.

Go away.
Go away!

(SHELDRAKE hurries off. In the studio, DEMILLE has been attempting to set up his shot.
Now, however, unable to ignore the kerfuffle surrounding NORMA,
he steps down and approaches her; NORMA turns to him, radiant.)

Did you see
How they all came
Crowding around?
They still love me
And soon we'll be
Breaking new ground.
Brave pioneers.

Those were the days.

Just like before.

We had such fun.

We gave the world
New ways to dream.

We always found
New ways to dream.

(The red light goes on and the studio bell shrills.
VICTOR MATURE and HEDY LAMARR arrive
to take the place of their identically costumed STAND-INS.)

Let's have a good long talk one day.

The old team will be back in business.

Sorry, my next shot's ready.

(He begins to walk her towards the studio door.

Meanwhile, outside, JOE has moved over towards MAX and notices right away,
from the LATTER's thunderous expression, that something disturbing has happened.)

Mr. Gillis...

What's the matter, Max?

I just found out the reason for all those phone calls from Paramount.
It's not Madame they want. It's her car.

Oh, my God.

(DEMILLE and NORMA have reached the doorway of the studio.)

Now, you remember, don't you? I don't work before 10 or after 4:30 in the afternoon.

It isn't entirely my decision, Norma, New York must be consulted.

That's fine. You ask any exhibitor in the country. I'm not forgotten.

Of course you're not.

(He embraces her.)

Goodbye, young fellow. We'll see what we can do.

I'm not worried. It's so wonderful to be back.

(SHE turns and sweeps regally away towards her car, the door of which MAX is holding open.
DEMILLE waves goodbye to her; then, as the Isotta drives off,
HE shakes his head, disturbed, and moves, preoccupied, back towards the studio doorway.
HEATHER is waiting for him. BETTY rushes out of the soundstage)

Was that really Norma Desmond?

It was.

She must be about a million years old.

I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.

Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. DeMille.

(The shot is ready, and EVRYONE is waiting on DEMILLE's orders,
but HE pauses for a moment, in pensive mood, his hand on the back of his chair.)

If you could have seen
Her at seventeen
When all of her dreams were new,
Beautiful and strong,
Before it all went wrong;
She's never known the meaning of
Surrender;
Never known the meaning of
Surrender.

            Girl Meets Boy (Reprise)       
            JOE
How about
They don't know each other
He works the night shift
And she takes clases all day?
Here's the thing, they both share the same room
Sleep in the same bed
It works out cheaper that way

I've a feeling you're just kidding
But to me it sounds believable
Makes a better opening than that car chase scene
Girl find boy, borrowing her toothbrush
Or oversleeping
Or at her sewing machine

You know, it's not bad, there are some real possibilities...

Who's Norma?

Who's who?

Sorry, I don't usually read private cigarett cases.

Norma's a friend of mine: middle-aged lady, very foolish, very generous.

I'll say: this is solid gold. "Mad about the boy"?

So how's Artie?

Stuck in Tennessee. It rains all the time, they're weeks behind.
No one knows when they'll be back.

Good.

What's good about it? I'm missing him something fierce.

No, I mean this idea we had. It's really pretty good.
Back to work.

What if he's a teacher?

Where does that get us?
Don't see what good it would do.

No, it's great
If they do the same job

So much in common
They fall in love, wouldn't you?

Yes, but if he's just a teacher
Then we lose those scenes in the factory

Not if he's a champion for the working man.
Girl likes boy, she respects his talent

Working with someone can turn you into a fan

This is fun, writing with a partner

Yes, and it could be...

A helluva movie

Can we really do this?

I know that we can!

            Eternal Youth Is Worth A Little Suffering       
            ASTROLOGER
I don't think you should shoot before July 15th
Right now is a perilous time for Pisces
If you want 'til Venus is in Capricorn
You'll avoid a catalogue of crises

I need three more weeks to get these thighs in shape
No more carbohydrates, don't be naughty

We'll soon have you skipping like an ingenue
You won't look a day over forty

We have dry heat, we have steam

We have moisturizing cream

We had mud-packs, we have blood sacks

It's a rigorous regime

Not a wrinkle when you twinkle
Or a wobble when you walk

Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering

Eternal youth is worth a little suffering

Listen to your super ego not your id
Age is just another damn neurosis
I'll have you regressing back to infancy
And back into the womb under hypnosis

I inject the tissue of the fetal lamb
The forumla's the one Somerset Maugham owns
Just modest course of thirty-sevent shots
And you will be a heaving mass of hormones

No more crow's feet, no more flab
No more love handles to grab
You'll be so thin they'll all think you're
Walking sideways like a crab
Nothing sagging, nothing bagging
Nothing dragging on the floor

Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering
Eternal youth is worth a little suffering
Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering
Eternal youth is worth a little suffering
Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering...

            Who&#039;s Betty Schaefer?       
            NORMA
Is this what you're looking for, by any chance?

Why, yes.

Whose phone number is this?
I've been worried about the line of my throat.
I think this woman has done wonders with it.

Good.

And I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.

Very good.

Now it's after nine. I'd better get to bed.

You had.

Are you coming up?

I think I'll read a while longer.

You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?

I went for a walk.

You took the car.

I drove to the beach.

Who's Betty Schaefer?

Surely, you don't want me to feel as if I'm a prisoner in this house?

You don't understand, Joe. I'm under such a terrible strain.
It's been so hard I even got myself a revolver.
The only thing that stopped me from killing myself was the
thought of all those people, waiting to see me back on the screen.
How could I disappoint them? All I ask is a little patience, a little understanding.

Norma, there's nothing to worry about. I haven't done anything.

Of course you haven't. Good night, my darling.

I should have stayed there
Poor Norma
So desperate to be ready
For what would never happen
But Betty would be waiting
We had a script to finish
One unexpected love scene
Two people, both risking
A kind of happy ending
                Last Update: December, 23rd 2013

            Betty&#039;s Office At Paramount       
            It is night on the Paramount lot and BETTY is once again at her typewriter,
but this time there is some light on the standing New York street set,
which is being dressed for action the following day. JOE watches as BETTY finishes typing.

T-H-E E-N-D! I can't believe it, I've finished my first script!

Stop it, you're making me feel old.

It's exciting, though, isn't it?

How old are you, anyway?

Twenty-two.

Smart girl.

Shouldn't we open some champagne?

Best I can offer is a stroll to the water cooler at the end of the lot.

Sounds good to me.

(Pause)

I love the back lot here. All cardboard, all hollow, all phoney, all done with mirrors;
I think I love it better than any street in the world. I spent my childhood here.

What were you, a child actress?

No, but my family always expected me to become a great star.
I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing, everything you can think of;
then the studio made a test.

JOE (Laughing)
That's the saddest story I ever heard.

Not at all. Come on.

(Pause)

I was born two blocks from here. My father was head electrician at the studio until he died,
and Mother still works in wardrobe.

Second generation, huh?

Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.

(As THEY walk down the Manhattan street, the stage begins to revolve slowly,
so that THEY end up walking Downstage;
and the flimsy struts holding up the substantial sets are gradually revealed.

JOE and BETTY walk in silence for a while; BETTY's expression is deeply preoccupied.
They come to a halt in front of the water cooler.)

I guess it is kind of exciting, at that, finishing a script.

(HE fixes a couple of paper cups of water, and hands one to BETTY,
who's miles away and comes to with a start when he touches her arm.)

What?

Are you all right?

Sure.

Something's the matter, isn't it?

(Pause. Then BETTY blurts out.)

I had a telegram from Artie.

Is something wrong?


He wants me to come out to Tennessee.
He says it would only cost 2 dollars to get married in Clinch.

Well, what's stopping you! Now we've finished the script...

(He breaks off, amazed to see that SHE's crying.)

Why are you crying? You're getting married, isn't that what you wanted?

Not any more.

Don't you love Artie?

Of course I do. I'm just not in love with him any more, that's all.

Why not? What happened?

You did.

(Suddenly, THEY're in each other's arms. A long kiss.)

When I was a kid,
I played on this street,
I always loved illusion.
I thought make-believe
Was truer than life
But now it's all confusion.

Please can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know any more.
If this is real,
How should I feel?
What should I look for?

If you were smart,
You would keep on walking
Out of my life,
As fast as you can.

I'm not the one
You should pin your hopes on,
You're falling for
The wrong kind of man.

This is crazy.
You know we should call it a day.
Sound advice, great advice,
Let's throw it away.

I can't control
All the things I'm feeling,
I haven't got a prayer.

If I'm a fool,
Well, I'm too much in love to care.
I knew where I was,
I'd given up hope,
Made friends with disillusion.

No one in my life,
But I look at you,
And now it's all confusion.

Please can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know any more.
If this is real,
How should I feel?
What should I look for?

I thought I had
Everything I needed.
My life was set,
My dreams were in place.
My heart could see
Way into the future.
All of that goes
When I see your face.

I should hate you,
There I was, the world in my hand.
Can one kiss kiss away
Everything I planned?

I can't control
All the things I'm feeling,
I'm floating in mid-air.
I know it's wrong,
But I'm too much in love to care.

(They fall into each other's arms and embrace passionately.
Then JOE leads BETTY by the hand back into the office.
They kiss again and it is obvious that THEY're about to make love.)

I thought I had everything I needed
My life was set, my dreams were in place
My heart could see way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face
This is crazy! You know we should call it a day

Sound advice

Great advice

Let's throw it away...
I can't control all the things I'm feeling
We're floating in mid-air
If we are fools, well,
We're too much in love to care
If we are fools, well,
We're too much in love to care!

            New Ways To Dream (Reprise)       
            JOE
What's the matter there, Max? You waiting to wash the car?

Please be careful when you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.

Suppose I tiptoe up the back stairs and get undressed in the dark, will that do it?

It's just that I am greatly worried about Madame.

Well, we're not helping any, feeling her lies, more lies.
What's going to happen when she finds out they're not going to make her picture?

She never will. That is my job.
I made her a star and I will never let her be destroyed.

You made her a star?

I directed all her early pictures. In those days,
there were three young directors who showed promise: D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille and --

Max von Mayerling.

That's right.

When we met, she was a child
Barely sixteen
Awkward and yet, she had an air
I've never seen
I knew I'd found my perfect face
Deep in her eyes
New ways to dream
And we inspired
New ways to dream

Talkies came; I stayed with her, took up this life
Threw away fame
Please understand
She was my wife

We had achieved far more than most
We gave the world new ways to dream
Everyone needs new ways to dream

Are you saying you were married to her?

I was the first husband.

So I play this game
Keeper of the flame
Sharing with her one last dream
Don't you think I knew it never could come true?
She'll be the very last one to surrender
I will not allow her to surrender

            The Phone Call       
            NORMA
Hello, is this Gladstone 9281? Miss Schaefer?...
Hello, Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling so late, but I really feel it's my duty.
It's about Mr. Gillis...you do know a Mr. Gillis?
Well, exactly how much do you know about him?
Do you know where he lives? Do you know what he lives on?

I want to spare you a lot of sadness
I don't know what he's told you
But I can guarantee you
He doesn't live with mother
Or what you'd call a roommate
He's just a ... I can't say it
Poor Betty
You ask him
I'd love to hear his answer...

...Joe...

That's right, Betty, why don't you ask me?...

Don't.

...Or better yet, come over and see for yourself. Yes, right now.
The address is ten thousand eighty-six, Sunset Boulevard.

Don't hate me, Joe. I did it because I need you. Look at me. Look at my hands.
Look at my face. Look under my eyes. How can I go back to work if I'm wasting
away?
No! Don't stand there hating me, Joe. Shout at me, strike me, but say you don't hate me...Joe, Joe.

Come on in.

What's going on, Joe?
Why am I so scared?
What was that woman saying?
She sounded so weird
I don't understand...

Please, can you tell me what's happening?
You said you loved me tonight
Shall I just go?
Say something, Joe

Have some pink champage and caviar
When you go visit with a star
The hospitality is stellar

So this is where you're living?

Yes, it's quite a place, sleeps seventeen
Eight sunken tubs, a movie screen
A bowling alley in the cellar

I didn't come to see a house, Joe

Sunset Boulevard
Cruise the Boulevard
Win yourself a Hollywood palazzo
Sunset Boulevard
Mythic Boulevard
Valentino danced on that terrazzo

Who's it belong to?

Just look around you

That's Norma Desmond.

Right on the money
That's Norma Desmond
That's Norma Desmond
That's Norma Desmond
That's Norma Desmond

Why did she call me?

Give you three guesses

It's the oldest story in the book
Come see the taker being took
The world is full of Joes and Normas
Older woman, very well-to-do
Meets younger man, the standard cue
For two mechanical performers

Just pack your things and let's go.

You mean all my things?
Have you gone mad?
Leave all these things I've never had?
Leave this luxurious existence?

You want me to face that one-room hell
That murphy bed, that rancid smell
Go back to living on subsistence?

It's no time to begin a new life
Now I've finally made a perfect landing
I'm afraid there's no room for a wife
Not unless she's uniquely understanding
you should go back to Artie and marry the fool
And you'll always be welcome to swim in my pool

I can't look at you any more, Joe.

Thank you, thank you, Joe, thank you...thank you.

What are you doing, Joe?
You're not leavine me?

Yes, I am, Norma.

You can't! Max!

It's been a bundle of laughs
And thanks for the use of the trinkets
A little ritzy for the copy desk back in Dayton

And there's something you ought to know
I want to do you this favour
They'll never shoot that hopeless script of yours
They only wanted your car

That's a lie! They still want me!
What about all my fan-mail?

It's Max who writes you letters
Your audience has vanished
They left when you weren't looking
Nothing's wrong with being fifty
Unless you're acting twenty

I am the greatest star of them all.

Goodbye, Norma.

No one ever leaves a star

And as dawn breaks over hte murder house, Norma Desmond, famed star of yesteryear,
is in a state of complete mental shock.

This was dawn...
I don't know why I'm frightened...
Silent music starts to play!
Happy New Year, Darling...
If you're with me, next year will be,
Next year will be...
They bring in his head on a silver tray!
She kisses his mouth!
She kisses his mouth!
She kisses his mouth...
...Mad about the boy...
They'll say Norma's back at last!
Madame, the cameras have arrived.
Max! Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace. And they're waiting for your dance.
Of course. Now I remember. I was so frightened I might fall...
You are the greatest star of all!
Lights!
Cameras!
Action!

I can't go on with the scene! I'm too happy! May I say a few words, Mister DeMille? I can't tell you how wonderful it is to back in this studio making a picture. I promise you--I will never desert you again. This is my life. It always will be. There is NOTHING else. Just us. And the cameras. And all you wonderful people, out there in the dark. And now, Mister DeMille, I am ready for my close-up.

When he scored me I
Knew he'd have to die
Let me kiss his severed head
Compromise or death
He fought to his last breath
He never had it in him to surrender
Just like me, he never could surrender

I'm staying for good
I'll be back where I was born to be

            On the Road       
            JOE's car noses into one of the main boulevards near Paramount;
but the FINANCEMEN come roaring up in pursuit.
JOE hits the gas and a high-speed chase ensues.
Finally, after a hair-raising dash through the Holmby Hills,
JOE's car turns onto Sunset, gains some distance with an enterprising U-turn
and then suffers a sudden blow-out. With some difficulty,
JOE manages to control the car and turns into an open driveway,
which then curves away from the street
so that the FINANCEMEN thunder by without seeing JOE's car.
