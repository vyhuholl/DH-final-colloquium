A lotta locomotion that's what we need
From a locomotive who can take the lead
From the eastern ocean to the western sea
Locomotion's gonna carry me
A lotta locomotion that's what we need
If we are ever gonna get up speed
A lotta locomotion and the right approach
For there are lot of different kind of coach
Like me I'm Ashley I'm the smoking car
I've tried to knock the habit but my inside's used to tar
I know that if I don't give up I might choke or have a stroke
That scare me and when I'm scared -
Boy I need a smoke
Buffy at your service
Ever open wide
My microwave is cooking to warm you from inside
A lotta locomotion will do the trick
Come and bite my burger
I'm hot and cheap and quick
My name's Dinah I'm the dining car
I'll cook for you and listen while you lean upon my bar
I'll serve you with your dinner
While the train go loop the loop
Gee I'm sorry gentleman - I hope you wanted soup
A lotta locomotion that's what we need
If we are ever gonna get up speed
From the Eastern Ocean to the Western Sea
Locomotion's gonna carry me
My name's Pearl I'm a brand new girl
My spring still bounce my fan still whirl
Ain't gonna smoke ain't gonna drink
What are you gonna do ?
What'd you think ?
A lotta locomotion that's what we need
If we are ever gonna get up speed
From the Eastern Ocean to the Western Sea
Don't stop the piston stroking
Don't stop the fireman stoking
Don't make me give up smoking
Give up smoking ? You gotta be joking !
Locomotion's gonna carry me
Oh boy - here come trouble It's the reigning champion

Generating twenty seven hundred horse
Camshaft rolling while the rocker rock

Enjoying the occasional smoke
Now I hang around the fuel dump
Sniffing the coke
It really choke me

Could have been a winner
I had what it take
But I wasn't in the right place
At the right time
Didn't have the rhythm
Didn't have the rhyme
I wasn't in the right place
At the right time
Could've been a contender
Could've been a star
Never reached the final
Didn't get that far
'Cos I wasn't in the right place
At the right time
Didn't have the rhythm
Didn't have the rhyme
I wasn't in the right place
At the right time
Any time they seem to
Open up the door
Slam it in your face
And knock it to the floor
'Tisn't only me son
'Tisn't only you
All of u are loser
All of u are through
'Cos I wasn't in the right place
Wasn't in the right place
Wasn't in the right place
At the right time
Starlight Express Starlight Express
Only you have the power within you
Just believe in yourself -
The sea will part before you
Stop the rain turn the tide

I must find Pearl
I must find Pearl
I must find Pearl
I must find Pearl
Clear my track you've had your chance now
I'll find another line no comeback
Losing's not my style
So i can't show my face now
Find another place now
Didn't win so i'll go
Don't try to persuade me
Losing always wreck it
This is my last exit
Stand by to fade me
No comeback this is the last time
We'll never meet again no comeback
No comeback this is the last time
We'll never meet again no comeback
No come no come no come no come
No comeback no comeback
No come no come no come no come
No comeback no comeback
Adieu mon ami addio mia cara
Auf weidersein mein leib sayonara
Eat my dust
No comeback this is the last time
We'll never meet again no comeback
No comeback this is the last time
We'll never meet again no comeback
One Rock 'n' Roll too many
One night's sleep too few
Too much ringing that bell
Takes it toll out of you
The sound's too loud
The light's too bright
My chain are too heavy
And my pant are too tight
One Rock 'n' Roll too many
Takes it toll out of you
One Rock 'n' Roll too many
I can't take no more
Whaddya say?
I can't hear nothing
Whaddya say?
I can't hear nothing
I can't hear nothing
Whaddya say?
I said one Rock 'n' Roll too many
Takes it toll
And the soul
Out of you!
Look at me a woman calm and in control
No silly girl whose head's always turning
Nobody would guess that deep inside my soul
A brand new flame is burning
Only he ha the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
But I couldn't see before
That only he ha the power to move me
Take me hold me mold me change me and improve me
It's not funny anymore
Only he can make my burden light
Only he can make a wrong seem right
Only he can make the shadow bright
And make the darkness gleaming white
He
Him and me
Only he ha the power to move me
All the night I've wasted dreaming of the time
When I'd discover the one to guide me
Searching the horizon didn't realize
That all the time he wa beside me
Only he ha the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
Hope and pray that I'm in time
Only he can stand and wait that long
Stand by me while I wa going wrong
What if he couldn't wait?
Have I left it too late?
Only he ha the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
Him and me we'd be sublime
And he still would never guess
That next time I'm gonna answer yes
Does he know if he come back today
This time I'm gonna make him stay?
He
Only he
Only he ha the power every day every hour
He move me
Only you
Have the power to move me
And together we'll make
The whole world move in sympathy
But I could not see before
Only you
Have the power to move me
Take me hold me mould me
Change me and improve me
It's not funny anymore
There wa I
There wa I
Wondering why
I wa wondering why
Every day
Disappeared into the distance
Now with you
The light is shining through
Both
You gave me life not just existence
Only you
You are the starlight
Have the power to move me
And together we'll make
The whole world move in sympathy
Only you
Have the power to move me
Move me
There wa I
There wa I
Wondering why
Wondering why
Every day disappeared into the distance
Now with you
The light is shining through
You gave me life not just existence
Only you
Only you
Have the power to move me
And together we'll make
The whole world move in sympathy
But I could not see before
I couldn't see it before
That only you
Have the power to move me
Take me hold me mould me
Change me and improve me
Only you
Only you
Have the power
To move me
Diesel is for unbeliever Electricity is wrong
Steam ha got the power that will pull u along -
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
The inside might be a black a the night
But there's a light at the end of the tunnel
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
The inside might be a black a the night
But at the end of the tunnel there's a light
It's the power of James Watt the steaming Scot
The man sho watched the pot and said Hey I've got
A brilliant plot when the steam is hot
It seems to make a lot of power
It could turn a wheel 
Lots of power 
It could drive it down a track 
Clickety clack clinkety clack
It could drive it with a beat 
Choo-choo-choo
With enough left over for a
Whoo-whoo!
He saw the light at the end of the tunnel
I said he saw the light at the end of the tunnel
Thanks James Watt thank you Mr Watt
For watching the pot
He saw a light at the end of the tunnel
He saw a light at the end of the tunnel
The inside might be s black a the mnight
But at the end of the tunnel there's a light
There are dark day ahead
When the power go dead
When the oil run dry
What can we try?
We could use the sunlight
Bit it don't shine at night
Nuclear fission
Leaves a nasty emission
Soon the piston will be humming
Steam will have a second coming -
We saw light at the end of the tunnel
We saw light at the end of the tunnel
Just dig a hole and haul out the coal
We saw light at the end of the tunnel
We saw light at the end of the tunnel
So let the water boil - goodbye to oil
At the end of the tunnel there's a light
We saw light at the end of the tunnel we see the light
We saw light at the end of the tunnel we see the light
When the Angel Gabriel blow his magic toot
We saw light at the end of the tunnel we see the light
We saw light at the end of the tunnel we see the light

I'm guess im not too good at keeping love alive for long
I think ive found the answer but the answer always wrong
My first love wa my true love and it should have been my last
The only time im happys when im dreaming in the past
Next time you fall in love it better be with me the way it used to be
Back then wa when we touched the Starlight
Sometimes you turn away from what your heart tell you is right
And so you settle for whatever get you through the night
The flame you thought wa dead may sudenely begin too burn
And broken heart can be repaired thats somthing that you learn
Ive relived every moment that i've ever shared with you
What fool we were to end a dream that looked like coming true
I guess im not too good at keeping love alive for long
I think ive found the answer but the answer always wrong
My first love wa my true love and it should have been my last
The only time im happys when im dreaming in the past
