It is my sad duty to inform you
that Eva Pern spiritual leader
of the nation entered immortality
at 8:25
this evening
- You are not welcome here
- He wa the father of my child too
They have a right to see him
to pay their last respect
You are not his wife
Your child are bastard
No no! He's my papa!
Oh what a circus!
Oh what a show!
Argentina ha gone to town
Over the death of an actress
Called Eva Pern
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all
Of the misery right
Oh what an exit
That's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried
Like Eva Pern
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country
In a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all
The world's paper today
But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess ha lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?
She had her moment
she had some style
The best show in town wa the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada
Crying Eva Pern
But that's all gone now
As soon a the smoke
from the funeral clear
We're all gonna see and how
She did nothing for year
You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted
Not much to ask for
But in the end you
Could not deliver
Sing you fool but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayer
because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead
your king is through
She's not coming back to you
Show business kept u all alive
Since 17 October 1945
But the star ha gone
the glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state
for a state to be in
Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of idea a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much but she said it loud
Sing you fool but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayer
because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead
your king is through
She's not coming back to you!
Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary
Unimportant
And undeserving
Of such attention
Unless we all are
I think we all are
So share my glory
So share my coffin
So share my glory
So share
my coffin
It's our funeral too
Senor Magaldi?
It's seven o'clock You'll be late
Now Eva Pern
Had every disadvantage
You need if you're going to succeed
No money no cash
No father no bright light
There wa nowhere she'd been
At the age of 15
As this tango singer found out
Agustin Magaldi
Who ha the distinction
of being the first
Man to be of use
To Eva Duarte
On this night of 1000 star
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitar
Plays for evermore
In the glow of those twinkling light
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million night
Fly away with me
I never dreamed that a kiss
could be a sweet a this
Now I know that it can
I used to wander alone
without a love of my own
I wa a desperate man
But all my grief disappeared
And all the sorrow I'd feared
wasn't there any more
On that magical day
when you first came my way
mi amor
On this night
On this night
On this night of 1000 star
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitar
Plays for evermore
To think that a man
a famous a you are
Could love a poor little nothing like me
I want to be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
She want to be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
Just listen to that
They're onto you Magaldi
I'd get out while you can
It's happened at last
I'm starting to get started
I'm moving out with my man
Now Eva don't get carried away
Monotony passed suburbia departed
Who could ever be fond
of the back of beyond
Don't hear word that I didn't say
What's that?
You desert the girl you love?
The girl I love?
What are you talking about?
She really brightened up
your out of town engagement
She gave you all she had
She wasn't in your contract
You must be quite relieved
That no one's told the paper
So far
I want to be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
Would I have done
What I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would stay together?
Seems to me there's no point in resisting
She's made up her mind
you've no choice
Why don't you be the man
who discovered her?
You'll never be remembered for your voice
The city can be paradise
For those who have the cash
The class and the connection
What you need to make a splash
The like of you get swept up
In the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class
Screw the middle classes!
I will never accept them
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight
Hidden from view at his funeral
Do all your one night stand
Give you this trouble?
Eva beware of the city
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled
It is mad
Those who are fool
are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become
What they should not become
Changed in short they go bad
Bad is good for me
I'm bored so clean and so ignored
I've only been predictable respectable
Birds fly out of here
So why oh why oh why the hell can't I?
I only want variety of society
I want to be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
She want to be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
Five year from now I shall come back
And finally say
You have your way
Come to town
But you'll look at me
with a foreigner's eye
The magical city
A younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down
All you've done to me
Was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city game all right didn't I?
I already know what cook
How the dirty city feel and look
I tasted it last night didn't I?
I'm gonna be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
She's gonna be a part of B.A
Buenos Aires Big Apple
Eva beware your ambition
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled will run wild
This in a man is danger enough
But you are a woman
Not even a woman
Not very much more than a child
And whatever you say
I'll not steal you away
What's new Buenos Aires?
I'm new
I want to say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too
I get out here Buenos Aires
Stand back
You oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
Fill me up with your heat
With your noise with your dirt overdo me
Let me dance to your beat
Make it loud let it hurt run it through me
Don't hold back
You are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying
Hello Buenos Aires
Get this! Just look at me
Dressed up somewhere to go
We'll put on a show
Take me in at your flood give me speed
Give me light set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood
Wine me up with your night
Watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing
Stand back Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
And
If ever I go to far
It's because of the thing you are
Beautiful town
I love you
And
If I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown
And silence
You're a tramp you're a treat
You will shine to the death
You are shoddy
But you're flesh you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit I'll find way of paying
Rio de la Plata
Florida Corrientes Nueve de Julio
All I want to know
Stand back Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch
Just a little touch
Just a little touch of star quality
I don't expect my love affair
To last for long
Never fool myself
That my dream will come true
Being used to trouble
I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it
Wouldn't you?
- So what happens now?
- Another suitcase in another hall
- So what happens now?
- Take your picture off another wall
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Time and time again
I've said that
I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom
That I'm hard through and through
But every time it matter
All my word desert me
So anyone can hurt me
And they do
- So what happens now?
- Another suitcase in another hall
- So what happens now?
- Take your picture off another wall
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Call in three month time
And I'll be fine
I know
Well maybe not that fine
But I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the name and place
Of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation
Here and now
- So what happens now?
- Another suitcase in another hall
- So what happens now?
- Take your picture off another wall
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Don't ask any more
Good night and thank you whoever
She's in every magazine
Been photographed seen
She is known
We don't like to rush
but your case ha been packed
If she's missed anything
you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dy
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both
stop fooling ourselves
Which means...!
There is no one no one at all
Never ha been and never will be a lover
male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
In fact they rely on trick
they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
will help them or keep them
Support them promote them
Don't blame them
You're the same
Good night and thank you Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book
on the way out the door
And that will be all
If she need you she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dy
But when we were hot
we were hot
I know you'll look back
on the good time we shared
Which means...!
There is no one no one at all
Never ha been
and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
In fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them
Support them promote them
Don't blame her
You're the same
There is no soap
No soap like Zaz
No detergent lotion or oil
With such power
In the shower
It's the mother and father
Of luxury lather
The talk of the bath
The great ointment
One little frolic
With new Zaz carbolic
You're scented
You'll be sent
Good night and thank you Senor Jabn
We are grateful
You found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you
every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay
but you'd be in the way
So do up your trouser and go
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dy
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion wa just too intense to survive
Which means...!
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone ha made u look fool
Argentine men call the sexual shot
Someone ha altered the rule
Fame on the wireless a far a it go
Is all very well but every girl know
She need a man she can monopolise
With finger in dozen of different pie
Oh but it's sad
when a love affair dy
In June of '43
There wa a military coup
Behind it wa a gang called
The G.O.U
Who did not feel
The need to be elected
They had themselves a party
at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right
of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two
And very few objected
Just one shell
And government fall like fly
Ka-pow die!
They stumble and fall
Bye bye!
Backs to the wall!
Aim high!
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet ruled
As democracy died
The lady's got potential
She wa setting her sight
On making it in movie
with her name in light
The greatest social climber
since Cinderella
OK she couldn't act
But she had the right friend
And we all know
a career depends
On knowing the right fella
To be stellar
Just one shell
And government lose their nerve
Ka-pow die!
They stumble and fall
Bye bye!
Backs to the wall!
Aim high!
We're having a ball
That's how we get
The government we deserve
Now the man behind the president
calling the shot
Involved so discreetly
in a lot of their plot
Was Colonel Juan Pern
Would-be dictator
He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise
from the very front row
And reckoned he'd do likewise
Sooner or later
Just one blast
And the tear gas fall like rain
Ka-pow die!
They haven't a chance!
Bye bye!
The terrorist advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hand
Pern wa biding time out
In the slow lane
Suddenly an earthquake hit
The town of San Juan
Ka-pow die!
They stumble and fall
Bye bye!
Keep away from the wall!
But one guy
Was having a ball
The tragedy a golden chance for Pern
He organised a concert
With incredible flair
In aid of all the victim
Such a grand affair
Politicians actor
Stars of every flavour
It wa January 22 1944
A night to remember that's for sure
For that's the night
that Pern first met Eva
For that's the night
that Pern first met Eva
On this night
On this night
On this night of 1000 star
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitar
Plays for evermore
Ladies and gentleman
Augustin Magaldi!
Magaldi?
Eva Duarte?
Your act hasn't changed much
Neither ha yours
I stand here
a a servant of the people
As we come together
for a marvellous cause
You've shown by your presence
Your deed and applause
What the people can do
True power is yours
Not the government's
Unless it represents
The people
One always pick
The easy fight
One praise fool
One smother light
One shift
From left to right
Politics
The art of the possible
Colonel Pern?
Eva Duarte?
I've heard so much about you
I'm amazed
- For I'm only an actress
- For I'm only a soldier
- Nothing to shout about
- One of the thousand
- Only a girl on the air
- Defending the country he love
But when you act
The thing you do affect u all
But when you act
You take u away
from the squalor of the real world
- Are you here on your own?
- Yes Oh yes
So am I
What a fortunate coincidence
Maybe you're my reward
For my effort here tonight
It seems crazy
But you must believe
There's nothing calculated
Nothing planned
Please forgive me
If I seem naive
I would never want to force your hand
But please understand I'd be good for you
I don't always rush in like this
Telling stranger I'm too good to miss
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so
But you really should know
I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you
I won't go on if I'm boring you
But do you understand my point of view
Do you like what you hear
What you see
And would you be
Good for me too?
I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it get too light
That's not the reason
that I caught your eye
Which ha to imply I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you
Please go on You enthral me
I can understand you perfectly
And I like what I hear what I see
And knowing me
I would be good for you too
I'm not talking
Of a hurried night
A frantic tumble
Then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it get too light
That's not the reason
That I caught your eye
Which ha to imply I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you
There is no one no one at all
Never ha been and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
In fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them
Support them promote them
Don't blame them you're the same
Hello and goodbye
I've just unemployed you
You can go back to school
You've had a good run
I'm sure he enjoyed you
Don't act sad or surprised
Let's be friend civilised
Come on little one
Don't sit there like a dummy
The day you knew would arrive is here
You'll survive
So move funny face
I like your conversation
You've a catchy turn of phrase
You're obviously going through
Some adolescent phase
So what happens now?
So what happens now?
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Don't ask any more
At the watering-holes
Of the well-to-do
I detect a resistance to
- Precisely!
our heroine's style
We're glad you noticed!
The shooting stick
Of the upper class
Give her an inch
Aren't supporting a single as
That would rise for the girl
she'll take a mile!
Such a shame she wandered
Into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person
Has forced u to be blunt
No we wouldn't mind
Seeing her at Harrods
But behind the jewellery counter
Not in front!
Could there be
In our fighting corp
A lack of enthusiasm for
- Exactly!
Pern's latest flame?
You said it brother!
Should you wish
To cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess
Just mention her name
That isn't funny!
Pern is a fool breaking every taboo
Installing the girl in the army H.Q
And she's an actress the last straw
Her only good part
Are between her thigh
She should stare at the ceiling
Not reach for the sky
Or she could be his last whore
The evidence suggests
She ha other interest
If it's her that's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Bitch!
Dangerous Jade!
We have allowed ourselves to slip
We have completely lost our grip
We have declined to an all-time low
Tarts have become the set to know
I'm only a radio star
with just one weekly show
But speaking a one of the people
I want you to know
We are tired of
The decline of Argentina
With no sign of
A government
able to give u the thing we deserve
It's no crime for officer
to do a they please
As long a they're discreet
and keep clear of disease
We ignore we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the centre
where she's not qualified
We are forced to mark his card
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud but to be laid
Slut!
Dangerous Jade!
This ha really been your year
Miss Duarte!
Tell u where you go from here
Miss Duarte?
Which are the role
that you yearn to play?
Whom did you sleep dine with
yesterday?
Acting is limiting
The line not mine
That's no help to the Argentine
Can we assume then that you'll quit?
Is this because of your involvement
with Colonel
Pern?
- Good night thank you!
She won't be kept happy
by her night on the tile
She say it's his body
But she's after his file
So get back onto the street
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud but to be laid
The evidence suggests
She ha other interest
If it's her that's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Things have reached a pretty pas
When someone pretty lower class
Graceless and vulgar uninspired
Can be accepted and admired
Dice are rolling
The knife are out
Would-be president are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see u six foot underground
It doesn't matter
What those moron say
Our nation's leader are a feeble crew
There's only 20 of them anyway
What is 20 next to million who
Are looking to you?
All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll You'll be handed power
On a plate
When the one who matter
Have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree
To be called
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment
And that is why
All exile
Are distinguished
More important they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide
There's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have union on your side
- I'll not let them take you
- Eva! I have to go
A new Argentina
The chain of the mass untied
A new Argentina
The voice of the people
Cannot be denied
There is only one man
who can lead any workers' regime
He life for your problem
He share your ideal and your dream
He support you for he love you
Understands you is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
A new Argentina
The workers' battle song
A new Argentina
The voice of the people
Rings out loud and long
Now I am a worker
I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed
And I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Pern
May the nation let him save them
As he saved me
A new Argentina
A new age about to begin
A new Argentina
We face the world together
And no dissent within!
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we're ahead
I can see u many mile away inactive
Sipping cocktail on a terrace
Taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy doing nothing
It's attractive
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmare too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep
Momentum if it's you that you are following
Don't close door
Keep an escape clause
Because we might lose
The Big Apple
But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would take the country?
Pern ha resigned from the army
and this we avow
The descamisados are those
he is marching with now
He support you for he love you
Understands you is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
A new Argentina
The chain of the mass untied
A new Argentina
The voice of the people
Never be
and must not be
denied
Release him
How annoying
That they have to
Fight election for their cause
The inconvenience
Having to get a majority
If normal method of persuasion
Fail to win them applause
There are other way of establishing
Authority
A new Argentina!
The chain of the mass untied
A new Argentina!
The voice of the people
Never be
and will not be
and must not be denied!
People of Argentina
Your newly elected president
Juan Pern!
Argentinos!
Argentinos!
We are all worker now
Fighting against our common enemy
Poverty social injustice
Foreign domination of our industry
Reaching for our common goal
Our independence our dignity
Our pride
Let the world know
That our great nation is awakening
And that it heart beat
in the humble body
Of Juan Pern
And his wife
The first lady of Argentina
Eva
Duarte
De Pern!
It won't be easy
You'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nine
At six and seven with you
I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around
Trying everything new
But nothing
Impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild day
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And a for fortune
And a for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusion
They're not
The solution they promised to be
The answer wa here all the time
I love you
And hope you love me
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild day
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is
Look at me to know
That every word is true
Just listen to that
The voice of Argentina!
We are adored we are loved!
Statesmanship is more
than entertaining peasant
We shall see little man!
Evita Pern
La Santa Peronista!
Evita Pern
La Santa Peronista!
I am only a simple woman
who life to serve Pern
in his noble crusade to rescue his people
I wa once a you are now
and I promise you this
we will take the rich from the oligarch
Only for you for all of you
And one day
you too will inherit these treasures!
Descamisados!
Mis compaeros!
When they fire those cannon
when crowd sing of glory
it is not just for Pern
but for all of us! For all of us!
Things have reached a pretty pas
When someone pretty lower class
Can be respected and admired
But our privileged class is dead
Look who they are calling for now
High flying adored
So young the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing
Of all the talent a cross between
A fantasy of the bedroom
And a saint
You were just a back street girl
Hustling and fighting
Scratching and biting
High flying adored
Did you believe in your wildest moment
All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?
Were there star in your eye
When you crawled in at night
From the bar from the sidewalk
From the gutter theatrical?
Don't look down
It's a long long way to fall
High flying adored
What happens now?
Where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all
At 26
There are no mystery now
Nothing can thrill you
No one fulfil you
High flying adored
I hope you come to term with boredom
So famous so easily
So soon
Is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you
It's been done before
You'll despair
If they hate you
You'll be drained of all energy
All the young who've made it
Would agree
High flying adored
That's good to hear but unimportant
My story's quite usual
Local girl
Makes good wed famous man
I wa slap in the right place
At the perfect time
Filled a gap I wa lucky
But one thing I'll say for me
No one else can fill it like I can
There again I've more to do
Than simply get the message through
I haven't started
Let's get this show on the road
Let's make it obvious
Pern is off and rolling
Eyes! Hair! Mouth! Figure!
Dress! Voice! Style! Movement!
Hands! Magic! Rings! Glamour!
Face! Diamonds! Excitement! Image!
I came from the people
They need to adore me
So Christian Dior me
From my head to my toes!
I need to be dazzling
I want to be rainbow high
They must have excitement
And so must I
Eyes! Hair! Mouth!
Figure! Dress! Voice!
Style! Image!
I'm their product it's vital to sell me
So Machiavell me
Make an Argentine rose!
I need to be thrilling
I want to be rainbow high
They need their escape and so do I
Eyes! Hair! Mouth! Figure!
Dress! Voice! Style! Movement!
Hands! Magic! Rings! Glamour!
Face! Diamonds! Excitement! Image!
All my descamisados expect me
To outshine the enemy
I won't disappoint them
I'm their saviour
That's what they call me
So Lauren Bacall me!
Anything go
To make me fantastic
I have to be rainbow high
In magical colour
You're not decorating a girl
For a night on the town
And I'm not a second-rate queen
Getting kick with a crown
Next stop will be Europe!
The Rainbow's gonna tour
Dressed up somewhere to go
We will put on a show!
Look out mighty Europe!
Because you ought to know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch
Argentina's brand of
star quality!
People of Europe
I send you the Rainbow of Argentina!
Spain ha fallen to the charm of Evita
She can do what she like
It doesn't matter much
She's our lady of the New World
With a golden touch
She filled a bull ring
But if you're prettier than General Franco
That's not hard
Franco's reign in Spain
Should see out the '40s
So you've just acquired an ally
Who look a secure in his job a you
But more important
Current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset
Your trump card
Let's hear it for the Rainbow tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure
we had a few doubt
- Will Evita win through?
- But the answer is yes!
There you are I told you so
Makes no difference where she go
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate
The actress now?
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome
Isn't quite a good
She hasn't gone down
Like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced
By Argentine glory
They equate Pern with Mussolini
Can't think why
Did you hear that?
They called me a whore
They actually called me a whore!
But Senora Pern
It's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
More bad news from Rome
She met with the Pope
She only got a rosary
A kindly word
I wouldn't say the Holy Father
Gave her the bird
But Papal decoration
Never a hope
She still looked the part at St Peter's
Caught the eye
Let's hear it for the Rainbow tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure
we had a few doubt
- Will Evita win through?
- But the answer is
a qualified yes!
Eva started well no question in France
Shining like a sun
Through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the carefree day
She nearly captured the French
She sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
Face the fact
The Rainbow started to fade
I don't think
she'll make it to England now
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow
You'd better get out the flag
And fix a parade
Some kind of
coming home in triumph is required
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure
we had a few doubt
Would Evita win through?
- And the answer is
- Yes
- And no
- And yes
- And no
- And yes
No
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure
we had a few doubt
Would Evita win through?
And the answer is
- Yes
- Yes
Yes
Thus all fairy story end
Only an actress would pretend
Affairs of state are her latest play
Eight show a week two matinee
My how the world begin to turn
When will the chorus girl ever learn?
My how the world begin to turn
When will the chorus girl ever learn?
The chorus girl
Hasn't learned the line
you'd like to hear
She won't go scrambling
Over the back of the poor
To be accepted
By making donation
Just large enough
To the correct charity
She won't be president
Of your wonderful society of philanthropy
Even if you asked her to be
As you should have asked her to be
The actress hasn't learned the line
You'd like to hear
She won't join your club
She won't dance in your hall
She won't help the hungry once a month
At your tombola
She'll simply take control
As you disappear
Forgive my intrusion
But fine a those sentiment sound
Little ha changed for u peasant
Down here on the ground
I hate to sound childish ungrateful
I don't like to moan
But do you now represent
Anyone's cause but your own?
Everything done
Will be justified by my foundation
And the money kept rolling in
From every side
Eva's pretty hand reached out
And they reached wide
Now you may feel it should have been
A voluntary cause
But that's not the point my friend
When the money keep rolling in
You don't ask how
Think of all the people
Guaranteed a good time now
Eva ha called the hungry to her
Opened up the door
Never been a fund
Like the Foundation Eva Pern
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling on in!
Rolling on in!
Rolling on in! Rolling on in!
On in!
Would you like to try a college education?
Own your landlord's house
Take the family on vacation?
Eva and her blessed fund
Can make your dream come true
Here's all you have to do my friend
Write your name and your dream
On a card or a pad or a ticket
Throw it high in the air
And should our lady pick it
She will change your way of life
For a week or even two
Name me anyone
who care a much a Eva Pern
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling on out!
Rolling on out!
Rolling on out rolling on out!
On out!
The money kept rolling out
in all direction
To the poor to the weak
To the destitute of all complexion
Now cynic claim
A little of the cash ha gone astray
But that's not the point my friend
When the money keep rolling out
You don't keep book
You can tell you've done well
By the happy grateful look
Accountants only slow thing down
Figures get in the way
Never been a lady
Loved a much a Eva Pern!
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling in and out!
Rolling in and out!
Rolling in and out rolling in and out!
On out!
Eva!
When the money keep rolling out
You don't keep book
You can tell you've done well
By the happy grateful look
Accountants only slow thing down
Figures get in the way
Never been a lady
Loved a much a Eva Pern!
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling rolling rolling
Rolling in and out!
Rolling in and out!
Rolling in and out!
Rolling in and out!
Rolling in and out!
On out!
Pern is everything!
He's the soul
the nerve
the hope and the reality
of the Argentine people
We all know
that there is only one man in our
movement with his own source of light
we all feed from his light
and that is Pern!
And now she want to be
Vice-president!
That wa the over-the-top
Unacceptable suggestion
We didn't approve
But we couldn't prevent
The game of the wife of the President
But to give her intention
Encouragement
She's out of her depth
And out of the question
But on the other hand
She's all they have
She's a diamond in their
Dull grey life
And that's the hardest kind of stone
It usually survives
And when you think about it
Can you recall
The last time they loved
Anyone at all?
She's not a bauble
You can brush aside
She's been out doing
What we just talked about
Example gave u back our business
Got the English out
And when you think about it
Well why not do
One or two of the thing
We promised to?
But on the other hand
She's slowing down
She's lost a little of that magic drive
But I would not advise those critic present
To derive
Any satisfaction from her fading star
She's the one who's kept u
Where we are
She's the one who's kept you
Where you are
Turn a blind eye Evita!
Turn a blind eye!
Please gentle Eva
Will you bless a little child?
For I love you
Tell Heaven I'm doing my best
I'm praying for you
Even though you're already blessed
Please mother Eva
Will you look upon me a your own?
Make me special
Be my angel be my everything
Wonderful perfect and true
And I'll try to be
Exactly like you
Please
Mother Eva
Will you look upon me a your own?
Make me special
Be my angel be my everything
Turn a blind eye Evita!
Turn a blind eye!
And I'll try to be
Exactly like you
Amen
Amen
Why try to govern a country
When you can become a saint?
Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behaviour
But how long do you think
This pantomime can last?
Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're our saviour
When those who oppose you
Are stepped on or cut up
Or simply disappear?
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me say
Alter the time-honoured way
the game is played?
Tell me before you get
onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don't care what the bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them
But to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two
There is evil
Ever around fundamental
System of government quite incidental
So what are my chance
of honest advances?
I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo
Tell me before I seek worthier pasture
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further
than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?
Allow me to help you
slink off to the sideline
I'll mark your adieu with three cheer
But first tell me who'd be delighted
If I said I'd take on
The world's greatest problem
From war to pollution
No hope of solution
Even if I lived for 100 year
There is evil
Ever around fundamental
System of government quite incidental
So go if you're able
To somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate
In some tottering state
But not here dear
Is that clear dear?
Oh what I'd give for 100 year
But the physical interferes
Every day more
Oh my creator
What is the good
Of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart?
A serious flaw
I hope you know that
Your little body's slowly breaking down
You're losing speed
You're losing strength
Not style
That go on flourishing forever
But your eye your smile
Do not have the sparkle
of your fantastic past
If you climb one more mountain
It could be your last
I'm not that ill
Bad moment come
But they go
Some day are fine
Some a little bit harder
But that doesn't mean
We should give up our dream
Have you ever seen me defeated?
Don't you forget
What I've been through and yet
I'm still standing
Eva you're dying
So what happens now?
Where am I going to?
Don't ask any more
Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all
You believed in me
I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do
For our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passion alive
As we used to do?
Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me
Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance
And I'll let you see how
Nothing ha changed
Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me
You must
love me
The actress
Hasn't learned the line
You'd like to hear
She's sad for her country
Sad to be defeated
By her own weak body
I want to tell the people
Of Argentina
I've decided
I should decline
All the honour and title
You've pressed me to take
For I'm contented
Let me simply go on
As the woman who brings her people
To the heart of Pern
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder
For you to see me
I'm Argentina
And always will be
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of
To say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word
Is true
She had her moment
She had some style
The best show in town wa the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada
They're cry Eva Pern
But that's all gone now
The choice wa mine
And mine completely
I could have any prize
That I desired
I could burn
With the splendour
Of the brightest fire
Or else
Or else I could choose time
Remember?
I wa very young then
And a year
Was forever
And a day
So what use
Could 50
I saw the light
And I wa on my way
And how I lived
How they shone
But how soon
The light were gone
The choice wa yours
And no one else's
You can cry for a body
in despair
Hang your head
Because she is no longer there
To shine
to dazzle or betray
How she lived
How she shone
But how soon
The light were gone
Eyes hair face image
All must
be preserved
Still life
displayed forever
No le
Than she deserved
