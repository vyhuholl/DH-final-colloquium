            Nobody Understands Me       
            I've always played the fool around here
I'm starting to worry that
I rush through life forgetting to breath
We all need some time to adapt
No one understands
No one understands
What it’s like

I had high hope of silver and gold
I thought this could change for the best
My mom always said I wa named for a saint
but I never felt I wa blessed
No one understands
No one understands
No one understands
What it's like

I got your cure right here
Is that what you want to hear’
I've played the fool too many time
I've been catching up
For all my life
And it seems
It get harder to believe it get harder but
Be honest
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow we’ll survive

I turn this up a loud a it go
And it ain't doing much for the pain
It’s up to me and the heart on my sleeve
That hasn’t quite been the same
No one understands
No one understands
No one understands
What it's like

I got your cure right here
Is that what you want to hear’
I've played the fool too many time
I've been catching up for all my life and it seems
It get harder to believe
It get harder but
Be honest
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow we’ll survive

I'm in a field of landmines
A cruise ship to hell
O but I don’t think about that
It's so hard to find help
these day
When everyone's counting on me
But I'm burnt already

I got your cure right here
Is that what you want to hear’
I've played the fool too many time
I've been catching up for all my life and it seems
It get harder to believe
it get harder but be honest
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow
then we’ll survive

            Over The Rainbow       
            Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow sky are blue
And the dream that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the cloud are far behind me
Where trouble melt like lemon drop
High above the chimney top
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow blue bird fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebird fly beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?

Come out come out wherever you are and meet the young lady who fell from a star
She fell from the sky she fell very far and Kansas she say is the name of the star
Munchkins
Kansas she say is the name of the star
Glinda
She brings you good news Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred
Dorothy
It really wa no miracle What happened wa just this
The wind began to switch - the house to pitch and suddenly the hinge started to unhitch
Just then the Witch - to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch
Munchkins
And oh what happened then wa rich
*The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch in the middle of a ditch
Which wa not a healthy situation for the Wicked Witch
*The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch

We thank you very sweetly for doing it so neatly
Munchkin #2
You've killed her so completely that we thank you very sweetly

            Scarecrow
I could while away the hour conferrin' with the flower
Consultin' with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin' while my thought were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain
I'd unravel every riddle for any individ'le
In trouble or in pain
Dorothy
With the thought you'll be thinkin' you could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain
Scarecrow
Oh I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore
I could think of thing I never thunk before
And then I'd sit and think some more
I would not be just a nothin' my head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and be merry life would be a ding-a-derry
If I only had a brain
Dorothy
Ohh! Wonderful!
Why if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Scarecrow
They would?
Dorothy
Yes
Scarecrow
Where's Kansas?
Dorothy
That's where I live And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to the
Emeralk City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me
Scarecrow
Do you think if I went wtih you this Wizard would give me some brains?

            Tin Man
When a man's an empty kettle he should be on his mettle
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presumin' that I could be kind-a-human
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender - I'd be gentle and awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friend with the sparrow  and the boy who shoot the arrow
If I only had a heart
Picture me - a balcony Above a voice sings low
Dorothy
Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Tin Man
I hear a beat....How sweet
Just to register emotion jealousy - devotion
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper and I'd lock it with a zipper If I only had a heart
Dorothy
That wa wonderful! You know we were just wondering why you couldn't come with u to
the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart
Tin Man
Well suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there?
Dorothy
Oh but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already

And mortal are the sport
Of a mischievous fate
So welcome the peace

It is happiness to dream on
With every care left behind

She's so misguided
It's all so one-sided
That dimwitted girl dare tangle with me
She's prissy she's clueless and I want her shoeless
I'll show how fiendishly mean I can be
I want those shoe to establish just who's number one from the east to the west
Then I'll be complete
With the world at my foot
And red always suited me best
I know
I hold sway
Over all I survey
But I now neef a much bigger deal
The shoe are the key
To the making of me
So find her and bring to heel
When I get that footwear
From her and it's put where
It could have been- should of been
Right from the start
My power will grow
It will blossom and flow
Through the world through the year and straight to my heart
We all like to dance
So now here's your chance
You'll dance till your very last gasp
Gyrate project
You'll swelter sweat
And stumble right into my grasp
You'll find you can't stop
As you dance till drop
And stumble right into my grasp
Spoken
Enjoy your dance my pretties And now You My monkey My darling Yes It is time at long last for you to do your work Off you go and mop up the mess- I want that little girl and her mangy little dog But most of all I want my slipper Now go! Fly! Fly! Fly!!!!
