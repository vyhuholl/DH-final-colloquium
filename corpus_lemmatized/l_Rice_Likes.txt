I've been in love with 'em all
Every man in this dir'y ol' city
There's many a bloke I recall
Who's added some love to my kitty
Keep your virtue
I don't have time
Keep your lover
I'm changin' mine
Ive got so much lovin' that I'm
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Ladies don't face me and sneer
And think of your husband affection
With the husband you're holdin' so near
I've probably had a connection 
Keep your moral
I don't have time
Keep your lover
I'm changin' mine
I've hung every fruit on my vine
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Don't knock u poor lover of love
Our service is breif but so tender
We get your poor fella because
You forget the trick we remember oh yeah!
Keep your epic 
I don't have time
Keep your lover
I'm changin' mine
Come all husband
Get in a line
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Keep your effort
I don't have time
Keep your lover
I'm changin' mine
I've got so much lovin' that I'm
Twice in love every day
And I like it that way
Twice in love every day
Your view of me are quite beyond the pale
You assume I lead a life of total rest
When my day to day existence is a tale
Of neverending drive and zest
I hardly have a second I can truly call my own
It seems that every thirty minute another hour ha flown
The older you become the more you recognize the fact
One ha little time to meditate and even le to act
If you stagnate and semi-slumber 
You shall never make your mark
No slacker ha succeeded 
Since the day of Noah's ark
I can't exceed my alotted span 
No matter how I try
But I've quite enough to do 
Until I die
So you see how important 
And imperative 
Significant and vital
Is each second that we live
We must understand the gravity
Our life will be futility 
If we take 
More than we can give
Them's just word 
And we don't know 
If they're true
When you ain't talkin 
Jus' what else 
Can you do?
I have book to read on medicine 
Theology and law
There's a world I want to see 
I want to know what life is for
I have hope I have ambition 
I'll achieve them if I can
There's so much I want to do 
I'm a very busy man
I'm a very busy man
And so when every day begin
I make me out a list 
Of me most essential sin
From the catalog advice
I choose me favorite for the fall
It's enough for the day 
I never feel like any more
I am frankly unimpressed by your attitude 
I am not convinced that you are on the ball
You could do worse than show a glimmering of gratitude
For the fact that you're alive at all
I am a very busy man 
I have no time to throw away
I need twenty seven hour or more
In every working day
My hour to hour arrangement
Are a copmlicated squeeze
I do many thing I have to do 
In two or even three
I hardly have the time 
To justify myself to you
There are many more important thing 
That I could find to do
Time never wait 
And it's never on my side
My every waking moment
Must be fully occupied
I aint got no gift to bring
this aint paris it aint spring
No pearl for you to wear
I would'nt mind a bit of that
I don't have no shinning moon
we're bloody mile from june
but you know love is here
All them poet with their rhyme
their pretty word in time
are missing whats so clear
It dos'nt mean a thing to me
Painters they have missed it to
writters havent got a clue
they cant see love is here
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
thing i feel so plainly
and what matter mainly is
i got you here today
You wont get sweet word from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
king and queen are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
thing i feel so plainly
and what matter mainly is
i got you here today
You wont get sweet word from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
king and queen are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
thing i feel so plainly
and what matter mainly is
i got you here today
You wont get sweet word from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
king and queen are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
But you know love is here
Yes you know love is here
Yes you know love is here
It's easy to be careless let a lifetime hurry by
Live aimlessly forever and be nothing til you die
I would have let that happen but suddenly I found
My little world invaded by a strange and lovely sound
Softly through the rush and roar of day
When the still of night draw near
From the depth of somewhere far away
A strange and lovely song I hear
Tumblin' shape and cloud of melody
Spin my trouble through the air
Steal the key and find the harmony
Of a strange and lovely song so rare
Before all my dream were a pattern
Fading color of grey and brown and blue
But these pattern are changing to picture
And I feel like I am changing too
Though I wander through a haunting haze
Touched by sound I cannot see
I shall someday understand who play
Such a strange and lovely song to me
But these pattern are changing to picture
And I feel like I am changing too
Though I wander through a haunting haze
Touched by sound I cannot see
I shall oneday understand who play
Such a strange and lovely song to me
Who is this Barnardo chap who think he owns the town?
Someone's gotta show this mush that he need some takin' down
We'll get him if it kill u all That bloke is heading for a fall 
He's gotta go we'll do him in we'll get him in the end
Who the hell doe he think he is in everybody's way?
Someone's gotta sort him out Barnardo's gotta pay
We'll get him if it all we do That bloke will very soon be through
He's gotta go we'll do him in we'll get him in the end
Barbardo is a social pest his meddling day are gone
We'll run the blighter outta town Its time he's sat upon
We'll get him if it mean a war he'll soon see what we're standing for
He's gotta go we'll do him in we'll get him in the end
We'll get him in the end
