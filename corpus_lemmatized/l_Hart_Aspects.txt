Love
Love change everything
Hands and face
Earth and sky
Love
Love change everything
How you live and
How you die
Love
Can make the summer fly
Or a night
Seem like a lifetime
Yes Love
Love change everything
Now I tremble
At your name
Nothing in the
World will ever
Be the same
Love
Love change everything
Days are longer
Words mean more
Love
Love change everything
Pain is deeper
Than before
Love
Will turn your world around
And that world
Will last for ever
Yes Love
Love change everything
Brings you glory
Brings you shame
Nothing in the
World will ever
Why did I go back to see her...?
Alex it's all in the past
Off
Into the world we go
Planning future
Shaping year
Love
Bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom
Disappears
Love
Makes fool of everyone
All the rule
We make are broken
Yes Love
Love change everyone
Live or perish
In it flame
Love will never
Never let you
Be the same
The master builder is dead!
His head is all smashed in He fell right into the quarry
I can't see him up there now
This is terrible So in fact he couldn't do it
But he got right to the top
My...my...master builder!
The toast of the town? 
The hit of the year? 
The birth of a star? 
The end of a career!
Darling these thing happen
You turn round and tell u 
We're closed for two weeks!
Rose I thought of everything
You thought of nothing!
There are poster in the street 
And banner in the square 
Scream away feel free 
But at Ibsen not at me
Why did I agree 
To accept this bloody tour? 
The only thing in store 
Is two week of nothing!
Win some lose some 
What the hell
Working till I drop 
For an audience of four 
Three nun and your mother
It's no good complaining
And she only bothered 
Because it wa raining!
Love
Don't call me 'Love'!
This isn't personal
I don't care The theatre's my life
We will start the tour again 
In Lyon in two weeks! 
Rose the people there 
Are all Ibsen mad I swear! 
Come on show me a smile!
God I'm not in the mood
What's a fortnight or so?
With no money or food
Don't be glum
Don't let's be downhearted!
Don't waste your breath
We'll get by
Now Rose you must meet this young man! 
He's a dedicated fan -- 
Been in every evening!
Marcel don't run away -- 
I can see your little plan
It's an honor mam'selle 
I could watch you for hour 
You can't have forgotten 
I threw you the flower 
Mam'selle seeing you on stage 
Has changed my life!

That girl can really act! 
I could have sworn that she'd be here! 
She's got a great career -- 
She should play Salom?! 
Maybe I wa mad 
But she really seemed sincere
Please say you're not angry 
I just couldn't bear it! 
Please say you forgive me -- 
I want you to swear it! 
Of course I'm not angry -- 
I knew that you'd make it 
There's plenty of time
Here that's heavy -- I'll take it
I feel seventeen again!
So do I
Seeing is believing
And in my arm I see her
She's here
Really here
Really mine now --
She seems at home here
Seeing is believing
I dreamt that it would be her
At last
Life is full
Life is find now
Whatever happens
One thing is certain
Each time I see
A train go by
I'll think of u
The night the sky
Forever
He's young
Very young
But appealing --
I feel I know him
Seeing is believing
And I like what I see here
I like
Where I am
What I'm feeling
What are we doing?
Can you believe it?
A starving actress and
A star-struck boy --
Oh well I might
As well enjoy
This moment
Can you believe it?
Seeing is believing!
I never thought I'd be here
Is this
Really me?
Am I dreaming?
No way of knowing
Where this is leading
It's fun forgetting
Who we are
Who cares?
When now the world is far
Behind u
Seeing is believing!
My life is just beginning!
We touched
And my head
Won't stop spinning
From winning
Your love!
Wish my arm were longer
Or the gap wa wider
One more go and
That should do it
One more try and there --
That doe it!
You will rue the day
That you got me in this mess!
I've torn my one good dress!
You're really a charmer!
Rose I know this seems
Like a scene from Modern Times
The house is my uncle's --
All right I wa lying --
He's working in Paris
He won't come here prying
Oh Rose
Rose can't you see?
I would have said anything
To get you here with me
Shall I make some coffee...?
One cup of fresh coffee
Buys two kiss --
Shall we have dinner?
Whatever happens
We have this moment
Who need tomorrow
When we have today?
Tonight we'll mean
The thing we say
Forever
Seeing is believing!
My life is just beginning!
We touched
And my head
Won't stop spinning
From winning
Your love!
Damn the boy!
Damn the boy's
Damn-fool schoolboy antics!
Calm down now George
Nephew Alex break in stop
Stealing household supply stop
Living in sin stop
Please advise stop
My gardener J?r?me!
How very nice!
How sweet!
How handy!
My bed!
My brandy!
He sound like you --
I think you ought to introduce us!
Giulietta
You'd better cancel supper at Chez Max --
This week wa fun
It shouldn't end like this
This interlude wa heaven
How sad to think that it must end
When it had just begun
George you've got a painter's eye
Everything is magnified!
I know you're all he's got
But I don't see why you should go
No I must go
Our little fling ha done u good
I have my paint
You have your clay
We both have work
I know I know
Don't look so sad George!
What time we've had George!
There'll be more
Ah yes
That's true
George
There'll never be another you
But a you say you are his guardian
And sacrifice must be made
We must part
I'm afraid
So put Giulietta thought behind you
Forget about your broken heart!
Back to Venice
Tend my art
A love affair is not a lifetime
It's calendar and clock my friend
All good thing
Have to end
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this week will one day be
Life go on
Love go free
Life go on
Love go free
This is what I ought to feel on stage
Soaring up like snow-capped mountain
I feel your beauty and your rage
I could be those tumbling forest
I could play those jagged hillside
Star of mountain
Star of valley
Would Madam care for breakfast?
Will croissant and fresh coffee do?
Wonderful view!
Whenever we see those mountain
We will think of me and you
George insists on magnificent view
I think I should like your uncle
Alex she's beautiful Who is she?
My aunt Delia She wa an actress too
Delia! Was she famous?
Yes But she died very young That's why my uncle doesn't 
come down here very often Too many memory
Haven't I seen that somewhere before?
Not the one you're thinking of That's in the Louvre 
George did that one Some people call it fraud but he prefers to 
think of it a a tribute
En garde!
Fifteen love!
Promise me today will never ever end!
Caviar! Anchovies! Peaches in brandy! We can have a banquet tonight!
When he doe get down here George doesn't believe in having to rough it
I could get to like it here!
Let's not ever think of leaving!
Look at this Pierrot Carmen
For the ballroom? Or the bedroom?
M?rim?e L'Occasion I know this -- it's a wonderful play!
Really?
Let's do it You can be the priest I'll be Do?a Maria Colemenares
But I don't know anything about the theatre
I'll teach you We'll do it Tonight
What are you doing? Pull yourself together
This one is gorgeous!
It wa her favorite dress
He must have loved her so much
Rose leave thing a they are
I can just see her
I feel I know her
What doe this letter contain? Give it to me
But promise me not to read it while you are here Read it 
this evening -- wait till this evening Promise me And 
tomorrow...no never speak to me about it If you give it 
back I shall punish myself for my folly...but for God's sake 
don't scold me
Hand it over
Have pity I implore you I have resisted a long a I could 
but you mustn't open it here Oh God what are you doing? 
Father Eugenio I implore you For pity's sake give it back 
Father you are killing me
What are you doing? Pull yourself together
You must forgive this rude intrusion
But I really felt I had to say Well done"!
Oh uncle George
Come in come in
I've heard a million thing about you
And you are...?
I am Rose Vibert
I hate to spoil your fun
But I wa dying for a gin --
But don't let me disturb you
Oh it's nice to meet you
GEORGE warming to the situation
Surely M?rim?e's L'Occasion"?
Lemon? Ice?
The perfect play
Yet overstated
Yes that's true
And somehow dated now --
A living fossil!
How concise!
And Alex you show promise
Well he is my pupil!
Ah so this is your profession?
Rising star!
I'm sure I'm sure
I'm playing Hilde
In two week
The Master Builder"?
Yes
What a courageous girl you are
I hate to tear myself away
But I must go and change --
Please promise me you'll stay
I wouldn't dream of going far!
I'd like to be the first
To say She's perfect! --
A face like that
I haven't seen in years!
You must forgive u
For breaking in here
I'll make it up George
Have no fear --
But please don't throw
Us out of here
I beg you
Seeing is believing --
I saw her and I loved her
You must understand what I'm saying --
She's not just someone
A love affair is not a crisis
Enjoy it like a fine champagne --
Taste but never let it
Cloud the brain
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this time will one day be
Life go on
Love go free
Some girl are like that
They'll love you and leave you
But Rose --
There's only one Rose
I'm telling you
This is not some schoolboy game --
My life will never be the same
I look at you and
I knew it from the moment
I remember
That I saw her face
How many time I've
There could
Felt this way --
Never be
Ah the trick
Any other
Love can play
Love for me
GEORGE
Alex quick!
Some brandy!
You go
I'll go
Quickly
I'm going
Do forgive me
So unlike me
You looked just like her
My wife
Delia
I thought for a moment
The dress wa hers
But you look just a lovely --
It should be worn
I've caused such drama here
You mustn't think that
It wasn't meant my dear
I'd better leave you two alone
You're in no state to travel --
No
You won't go anywhere
You're staying in that chair
Why spend the evening on your own?
Why why must he spy on us?
It wa perfect till he came!
Why why must he ruin it?
Of course painting always wa my first love
Oh to be so gifted
When I'm dead they'll fetch a fortune
We shall see
I'd buy one now
You'd better tell her
Tell me what?
Before you sell her one
That they're just copy
But by me!
I'd love to hear your poems!
I shall write one for you
Byron isn't here to sue you
Alex please --
Don't interrupt
At least I do thing
Yes that's true
I see a few thing through
We often have dispute like these
Did Alex ever tell you
We'll be here till breakfast
Why his final year
At school wa rather short?
No not a word
No George you couldn't
Please go on!
No George you wouldn't dare
I think it might amuse her
I've had a splendid time
A truly splendid time --
But I can see that I'm de trop
I have a little tryst
Too tempting to resist
And now I really ought to go
I wish you both a charming fortnight
Enjoy your little one-to-one --
Have your fling
Have your fun
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what these day will one day be
Life go on
Love go free
I think I know where he's gone --
He's off to take his Italian lessons!
How could you have let me wear this dress?
He must think I have no feelings!
You should have said what he wa like
I must seem a heartless woman!
I must seem a soulless creature!
Anyway let's not have a scene
What wa that?
What?
There
Listen
It's her ghost
I'm frightened
Don't be silly I'll go and have a look
Well?
There's nothing there I suppose it must have been a rat
I can't sleep in a house full of rats!
Well I don't want you to sleep just yet
Alex Not now
Rose where are you?
Rose where are you?
I've been out walking
And what a day --
So crisp and clear!
And you're not spending it in here!
Let's breathe some mountain air!
I thought you'd left me
What do you say?
I had a dream you'd left me
Good idea?
Good idea!
Pas de tendresse
Et pa de joie
Loin d'ici
Loin de toi
Rien de plus triste
Que me soupirs
Lorsque vient le joir
Ou il me faut partir
Chanson d'enfance
Tu vi toujours dans ma coeur
Toi la plus douce!
Toi la plus tendre
Marcel want me in Lyon
He say that I'm needed today
Well it must be important
I won't go
I don't want to
I'll ignore it
How can I desert you?
It's all so unfair
So unfeeling!
How can you say that?
Don't be a fool Rose!
You can't put me before your whole career!
You can't let feeling interfere --
You must go!
I'll pick up my script and my dress
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this week will one day be 
George...you're wrong
Marcel -- how could he have known where she was? 
Unless she told him...or sent this herself And there wa I 
completely taken in when she wa going all along
No she couldn't
Oh God she wouldn't
Who's feeling lucky?
Twenty out of twenty
And a prize could be yours!
See Marie the Monkey
With the poisonous claws!
There's a prize
To be won!
Take a risk
Take a ride!
Right this way
Have a go!
Try your luck
And step inside!
If you reach
For the moon
If you aim
For the sky
Then the moon
And the sky
Can be yours --
Come on and try!
Everybody love a hero!
Let's hear it for the man with the gun!
Everybody love a hero
How you've grown!
It's been two year
You should have phoned --
Your uncle isn't here
I might have guessed!
And such a splendid uniform!
The same old painting
Madame will be so thrilled to meet you --
I'll go and tell her
Giulietta Trapani
Life ha changed!
Since those two met
He life life to the full!
Well good for him!
She ha made him young again!
Where is he now then?
He's doing up the country villa --
They plan to live there
Now tell me do you still like omelettes?
Won't be a moment!
And so he got his wicked way with that Italian girl --
He hasn't lost his touch
Well hello
I should have known
Where you were hiding --
You like the good life
George like trinkets!
God what a fool
I wa to love you!
What wa all my searching for?
It's never hard to find a whore!
Well if it make you happy think it
You scheming bitch
The truth is we're a perfect pair
Because he's rich
Shout and scream --
I don't care
You could have let me know...!
Your uncle's shown me new horizon
Well didn't I?
And a a lover he is perfect too
Another lie!
He take his time
Unlike you
I wasn't good enough?
Why can't you listen
And come to your senses?
It's George
I really love George
He's made me a 
Better fuller stronger person
I have never been a happy!
Or indeed a wealthy
Look I don't need your uncle's money!
And I could have a thousand lovers!
Yet I've been faithful and I'm happy --
More faithful than he'll ever be
It's not a if he's married me
I'd better go
I'm sorry
It wa a shock
Try and understand
And it won't hurt you so much
At least admit you loved me once
Of course I did
I may even love you now
George give me so much
But he get so little from me
But with you I made an impression
That will last you a lifetime
So change my life for me again
Here we go again!
Heaven know when she'll be back --
That girl ha got a knack
Of keeping you guessing!
Madame will soon be here
But she say you are to leave
Your uncle is coming
You'd better get going
So why all the panic?
Why shouldn't I be here?
She's scared that his heart
Couldn't stand all this drama
Well it's hardly a shock
If my uncle see me here
That girl is unbelievable!
Was last night the sort of thing
She could just forget?
It would be hard to find
A more capricious mind
What are you doing here?
All right where have you been?
Will you please disappear?
What the hell do you mean?
Leave me leave me!
I don't want George exposed
To some unpleasant scene
If I can't have you no one will
Killing you would be a pleasure
So all you're fit for is to kill?
Go on and pull the trigger
See if I care!
Come on soldier!
Be a hero!
You never loved me?
Does it matter?
You never meant it?
Who remembers?
And now you hate me
Go away you little
Schoolboy
My only genuine Matisse!
Thank God
No damage done
Would someone kindly tell me
What on earth ha happened?
He lost his head
The gun went off
She's bleeding badly
Use your scarf --
Here let me help
You'd better phone the doctor
I should never have come back here
Oh don't talk such nonsense!
I'll bow out now --
It's the decent thing to do
Don't be absurd
I'm a disaster
Oh come come!
It wouldn't last a week --
She'd be far better off with you
You two have your life before you
It would end in murder
I'm too old for her --
It's high time I withdrew
Your place is here
The jowl are dropping
It's the light
The paunch need propping up --
She'd be far better off with you
Your word are generous and selfless
But ala untrue --
She'd be far better off with you
You are steeped in wit and wisdom
Well I've learnt the odd thing
You could teach George Bernard Shaw
A thing or two!
I had a go
You've dined with Garbo
Only twice
Translated La Boheme --
She'd be far better off with you
You're athletic
You're distinguished
You don't cheat at croquet
You're more seasoned
You can skate
You're in Who's Who
Just half an inch
We're talking drivel
So we are
Can't we be civilized?
She'd be far better off with you
Your word are generous and selfless
But ala untrue
It's only Rose that matters!
Just take a look there's no comparison
Between u two --
She'd be far better off with you!
And then with a swift karate-chop 
I removed his gun -- 
You should have been there! 
Poor chap didn't know what hit him
Still George! 
If you can't keep your tongue still 
You will have the face of Edith Sitwell!
Ah well they're happy 
It's for the best anyway 
Let's face it 
He's the man for her 
And I'm the man for you dear
Don't talk such nonsense -- 
You'll never stop loving her 
You don't fool me 
You're quite besotted with her
Stop Wait Good Please 
Still George
With my scarf I made a tourniquet -- 
Shantung silk but worth the sacrifice -- 
It stemmed the flow the arm wa saved and
Still George 
Rose would seem the kind of lady 
Who would live through any blood-bath
Darling it's over -- 
So don't be so cynical 
I don't suppose that you've become a nun 
Since last I saw you
Wouldn't you love that! 
Perpetual chastity!
So tell me 
Have you found some young Adonis?
Stop Wait Good Please
No George
Time and light are fading -- 
Shouldn't we make the most of 
Every precious moment? 
Life is sweet and slow and still and
I'm not leaving here till I get what I came for...it's a 
scandal...out of my way...heaven help him if he won't 
pay...who are you pushing...I got here first...all I want 
is what's fair...he had better be there
For heaven's sake! 
Who's making all that mayhem?
Thank God you're here! 
We've got trouble with Rose --
Are you certain that
This is the man?
Running up bill 
Wherever she goes!
Is he the one
Footing the bill?
to the others
This is the man I wa 
Looking for
Is this the man?
This is your man!
Can you be certain that
This is the man?
Is this the right man?
This is the man 
Who will pay for 
The eighty-one phone calls!
I beg of you pay!
My poor mother is dying!
She loses her job if
These bill don't get settled!
If I lose my job then
This is the man
Who will pay for
The codeine and dressings!
I've called the police there
We'll call the police if
Are eight in the lobby!
The Doge's Suite!
Beluga caviar!
Twenty thousand lire!
You are the man 
I understand 
Who can clear my expense 
Here they are 
Thirty thousand lire!
Forty thousand!
Fifty thousand!
Nineteen
Twenty thousand lire!
Twenty-three
Thirty thousand lire!
Forty-eight
Forty thousand!
Forty-nine
Fifty thousand!
George I'm sorry...She's been very ill
George...George 
My life is draining 
Away
We'd best be on our way -- 
We'll leave you three alone
So this is Rose Vibert
The famous Rose Vibert
I have to talk to her 
Sit down and talk to her 
This can't go on another day
Rose what can I do with you? 
Wreaking havoc left and right -- 
It's absurd! 
She must change her way 
She must pas this passing phase -- 
Problem child 
Running wild
Rose I ought to strangle you! 
But there's a style about that girl 
That stop me in my track 
Heaven know why she 
Wants to waste her life with me
And yet if she went off 
If she set herself free 
As I've told her she should 
Where on earth would I be?
You'd be lost my friend
And so would she
And he said to me 
He really ought to buy that vineyard
Please Rose 
Don't you think you ought 
To take a little rest 
From George's foibles?
Well you'll have to learn to live with it 
That and all his other pet obsession 
God and Trollope 
Other woman
Please Rose!
George is a remarkable man 
He wa there when I thought I had no one 
He saw me through my darkest moment 
He made me talk about my husband
We had been married five day 
He drove like the wind 
Not any more
But George wa always there 
No matter when or where 
He stopped me feeling so alone
When did you meet him?
One evening at Harry's bar -- 
He wore a silver tie pin 
And a smile that wa even brighter
I know that tie pin -- 
It catch on everything!
And a for all those paint rag
Heaven help us!
We deserve a medal!
Nice to see that George ha settled in 
Fifteen novel on the go a always! 
Used to drive me to distraction
Please Rose!
Last year he forgot my birthday 
So I rearranged his bookmark
George dear we're talking -- 
We don't need you hovering
My darling you're completely right --
We're doing fine without you
I get the picture 
Condemn me to solitude!
You'll find some thing to keep you occupied
We'll call you if we need you!
Time and light are fading -- 
Shouldn't we make the most 
Of every precious moment? 
Life is sweet and slow and still 
And perfect! 
All the more now our man George 
Has brought the two of u together!
I never imagined she'd be like that -- 
Your lady friend come a a sweet surprise 
A wonderfully sweet surprise
Take a deep breath and prepare yourself 
I've been such a trusting fool 
Those wretched investment I made 
Have gone down the drain 
After today there'll be no more champagne 
The way of the world are cruel
If I ask a question 
Will you promise...? 
You must promise 
That the answer to my question is yes
Yes I'll say yes
Take a deep breath and prepare yourself 
My mind is in such a mess 
But really George 
All that I wanted to ask wa this 
Would you be willing to marry me?
I've already told you 
Yes
I now pronounce you man and wife
My dear congratulations!
Here's to the happy couple!
Here's to happy days! 
And even better nights!
You lucky man!
Well now we've done it!
And oh what fun it wa
And now I claim my best man's rights! 
Bravo bravo
News take time to reach u here 
So you're married 
How time fly 
And George will be a father soon 
That wa more of a surprise 
Perhaps one day we'll meet again 
If I ever leave the army
Live or perish 
In it flame 
Love will never 
Never let you 
Be the same
Love will never 
Never let you 
Be the same!
Natalia Petrovna Unhappy woman for the first time in 
your life...you are in love
If Turgenev were here 
He'd order champagne! 
A triumph my dear!
What a night to end with
Rose you were incredible!
They seemed to like it
I have never heard a crowd 
Make a noise like that!
It's your best production!
Are we in the mood
For debauchery and food?
Marcel you are a dear 
But a most forgetful man! 
I've told you that I plan 
To drive through the country
Well done darling 
Well done you
Have a lovely night! 
Come and see me when you can
Now come along Hugo
I'm ready don't worry 
I've done all the packing 
There's no need to hurry
Tonight wa a wonder!
A soaring sensation!
The best thing is having 
My friends' admiration
The perfect leading lady
Unique and true and towering!
Magnetic overpowering!
The star the crowd adore!
If they could only know you
Your humor and humility
Your strength and your fragility
They'd love you even more
Tonight wa a wonder!
All the dream we worked for
Have come true!
My shining leading lady!
Bravo bravo bravo!
I owe so much to you
Have I changed?
No not at all
You're too polite 
This face ha had it day
Don't be so silly!
Is it General Alex yet?
I hardly think so 
Two week without a script or camera! 
I can't believe it! 
And then another madcap movie
With Monsieur Cocteau 
George is sweet 
He say I'm like his favorite Juran?on 
Very strong and beautiful -- 
But hardly very sweet or subtle 
and not too heady
His head must be extremely strong then -- 
I'm drunk already!
What a life!
You're telling me!
What doe Jenny make of all this fame? 
Ask her yourself
Do you think I ought to come?
My darling you've become so bourgeois -- 
We'll have to change that!
The same old Alex 
I should be flattered 
You're never one to let a chance slip by
I'll never understand you till the day I die
I'm sorry
I think by now I'm old enough 
To put myself to bed 
Why don't you go and forge 
Another masterpiece instead?
Oh Jenny you're a monster! 
I should have had a son! 
It seems ala a father's lot
Is not a happy one!
You know I need my donkey
Why can't you just count sheep?
All right you have your donkey -- 
Now will you go to sleep?
I'm really thrilled for Mummy! 
Weren't they wonderful reviews? 
She'll be the toast of Paris! 
Mummy's always in the news!
You're right it is amazing 
How the work keep flooding in 
With appearance in London 
And movie in Berlin
Now off you go to bed -- 
I'll wake you when I hear the car!
Look Jenny go to bed -- 
God what a chatterbox you are!
Jenny 
You're a miracle! 
Is there nothing you conceal? 
Jenny 
You astonish me! 
Never hiding 
What you feel
Other pleasure 
And I've known many 
Afternoons 
In warm Venetian square 
Brief encounter 
Long siesta 
Pleasures old and new 
Can't compare with you
You amaze me! 
Where did you come from? 
You do thing 
Champagne could never do 
Crystal winter 
Crimson summer 
Other pleasure -- 
I would trade them all 
For you
Pleasures old and new 
Can't compare with you
Wild mimosa 
The scent of evening 
Shuttered room 
With sunlight breaking through 
Crazy soir?es 
Lazy Sundays 
Other pleasure 
I would trade them all 
For you
Sailing off 
In the night 
On a silver lake 
Taking more 
From this life 
Than I ought to take 
Other pleasure 
I would trade them all 
For you
Quickly! 
She's here now! 
Don't be an old lazybones!
Good Lord! 
The time! 
For once she's managed 
To arrive ahead of schedule!
Wait till you see 
What I've got for you 
Darling
And wait till you see 
What I've got for you
I don't believe this
I don't believe this
Good God I wondered what had happened to you!
Rose you really should have let me know!
Dear boy you must meet Jenny!
Hello cousin 
Nice to meet you
So you're the soldier?
This is Alex
You remember
Yes of course
He saw my last performance
She really wa phenomenal
A truly blazing star"!
Rose you're a wonder!
All the dream we've worked for 
Have come true
Big surprise 
I can't be with you this weekend 
But don't be cross -- 
You should thank me 
You wouldn't find me much fun 
It seems my life is one enormous drama! 
Men are such a dreadful nuisance 
I'll call you when I'm me again 
C'est la vie 
C'est l'amour
There is more to love
So much more
Than simply making love --
That's easy
Gazing into eye
Pretty eye
Which could be any eye --
That's crazy
Hands are just hand
A face is just a face
They come and go --
They're easy to replace
There is more to love
So much more
Than moon-struck escapade --
That's nothing
There is peace of mind
So much peace
In quiet company --
That's something
Everyone but him
Seems wrong for me
Every time I feel
There ha to be
More
If I could hear
The music I heard then
I'd never let
It fade away again
Now each time
Love reach out to me
I can only feel
There ha to be
So much more
To love
There is more to love
So much more
I trust you're staying for the vintage?
Oh he mustn't miss it!
Alex promise me you won't run off just yet!
There's lot of room!
I'm in no hurry -- 
If it won't worry you 
This could be something you'll regret!
Oh no! 
That's really disappointing!
What on earth's the matter?
Giulietta won't be with u this weekend
What's happened now?
Same situation
That girl's relationship 
Are too involved to comprehend!
Looks like I'll never meet your friend
One day you will old chap
It's time I took my nap
Good Lord the time ha really flown!
I'd better run along 
You'll have to manage on your own!
Part of me wa always in these hill 
This is where my eye were opened 
When life wa young and we had time 
I wonder why she brought me back here 
Why invite me? 
Why entice me? 
Why rekindle old emotions...?
I am a mermaid
With golden hair
I've never seen one like you!
Not all u mermaid
Have silver tail --
I have no tail at all!
Well I've never
Seen any mermaid
With knobbly knees!
I'd say this tale
Was a touch too tall
Maybe a touch too tall
Sailors would smash on
My jagged rock
Lured by my siren's song
It isn't the
Song of the siren
That torture men --
That's where your theory
Goes sadly wrong
That's where it all go wrong
I thought you'd know better
You know nothing
About mermaid
You know nothing
About sailor
I do!
Much more than you!
If you were a sailor
And heard my song
Would you be lured by me?
I wouldn't be
Foolish enough to
Go near your rock --
I'd steer my galleon out to sea
Lonely and lost at sea
Say the word! 
Say it now! 
Nice and loud!
What the hell then -- 
Uncle!
Jenny you're a monster! 
You ought to be locked up!
Before I am 
I think I'll dress for dinner -- 
You mix the drink
She need a Paris education 
I've told you time and time again
And wouldn't that be cozy? 
You could then have your very own Parisienne!
Alex how can you even think 
Of moving her away from this place? 
I mean Alex you of all people have found 
That leaving here is hard to face
Yes I love it here and always will 
But Rose it's not the view 
Or the vine that keep me here 
I stay year after year 
For something far deeper 
Being in this house 
Makes the past seem very near
When the world wa a playground 
All train-rides and laughter 
And love in the morning
And armagnac after
Since leaving the army 
And being around you 
I know I'm reliving 
The night that I found you
But George 
I couldn't hurt George 
Oh Alex you know by now 
How much I love him
So what is it 
You feel for Hugo?
Please understand I'm not in love with him 
He's a friend he make me laugh 
That's all it is 
Alex can't you see 
That you mean much more to me?
Alex that's why I won't 
Play the lover with you 
What I did to you once 
Wasn't easy to do -- 
But I only have one life 
Not two
I want to be
The first man you remember
I want to be
The last man you forget
I want to be
The one you always turn to
I want to be
The one you won't regret
May I be first
To say you look delightful?
May I be first
To dance you round the floor?
The very first
To see your face by moonlight?
The very first
To walk you to your door?
Well young man I'd be delighted!
There is nothing I would rather do!
What could be a sweeter memory
Than sharing my first dance with you?
I want to be
The first man you remember
The very first
To sweep me off my foot
I want to be
The one you always turn to
The first to make
My young heart miss a beat
Seems the star are far below u
The moon ha never felt so close before
Our first dance will be forever
And may it lead to many more!
I want to be
The first man you remember
The very first
To sweep me off my foot
I want to be
The one you always turn to
The first to make
My young heart miss a beat
I want to be
The one you always turn to
I want to be
The one you won't regret
The very first
The very first
Now that's what I call a wall!
It's a masterpiece!
It's Picasso!
Except it's straight
Hugo we should call you Samson!
He ha many talent
How you didn't break your back I'll never know!
No nor will I!
Thank God for Sundays!
Our wall will be the talk of Pau!
Two more day then off to Paris
And a school for Jenny
Didn't Jenny look a picture in that dress?
Indeed she did
So like her mother 
Shades of another time 
Of vintage night --
But I digress
Good Lord the time! 
Ah well God bless
Alex this ha gone on long enough -- 
What I mean is you and Jenny
I'll be off now 
See you both tomorrow
Since you came she's truly blossomed -- 
But my friend a flower is fragile 
Heaven help you if you hurt her
Why all this concern? 
God you're hardly ever here! 
Your whole life is your career 
And nothing else matter
My career? 
We wouldn't eat if I had no career 
You know that George lost everything 
I do it all for George and Jenny 
I thought you knew that
All right I'm sorry
Can't you see? 
What we three have is something very rare 
In a word it's happiness 
Nothing in the world will ever 
Tear apart the sweet existence 
We have spent a lifetime building!
Rose let me explain to you 
Yes I can't deny the feeling that I have 
But what's wrong with that?
Rose I'd never harm the girl
You were once prepared to do 
A lot of harm to me
You cannot compare 
This with our insane affair 
What I wanted from you 
Was both body and soul
Aren't you trying to play 
An identical role?
This is one thing that I will control
Do you remember the first time you fell in love? 
Did it make you happy or sad? 
Did you waste away and lie awake all night?
Yes I remember 
I cannot forget 
It's haunted my life since then
Pas de tendresse 
Et pa de joie 
Loin d'ici 
Loin de toi
Rien de plus triste 
Que me soupirs 
Lorsque vient le jour 
O? il me faut partir
How do you know that?
Mummy used to sing it to me 
That wa her love song 
Her very first love song
Love 
Love change everything 
How you feel and 
What you do
What 
What would you say to me 
If I told you 
I loved you...?
Then I'd have to say to you 
You are bright and sweet and foolish 
Yes love 
Love change everything 
But not always 
For the best -- 
Love can sometimes 
Be a most 
Unwelcome guest
You don't believe that 
You know you're fooling yourself 
Why not be honest?
Alex 
Be honest
Beluga caviar 
My finest vintage champagne 
And then a night of dance 
My ash to be scattered 
Among the vine at sunset
Oh do stop planning your wake! 
You're bound to outlive u all!
My funeral oration to be written by Giulietta 
Trapani
Rose we should talk -- 
I've got something on my mind 
It's Jenny 
Jenny and Alex -- 
The whole thing's unnatural 
For a girl of her age
You needn't be anxious 
He's explained all this 
And she's no longer a child 
It's just that he's younger 
And you're getting jealous 
Am I right? 
Anyway I'm filming in Paris 
And it's her birthday -- 
We promised we would take her to the circus -- 
George you know that I'm right
Maybe you're right 
Look you're free to keep your lover 
And your noisy Paris clique 
A man who's pushing eighty 
Is not exactly chic 
But Jenny's all I have now -- 
Don't let him take her from me
My darling George I love you! 
How dramatic can you be!
You think that I'm dramatic? 
Wait 
If we don't take some action 
We'll be too late
Take the journey of a lifetime!
It's only just a drum-roll away!
On the journey of a lifetime
Every day's a high-wire day!
If you've got what it take
The star and streamer are yours!
Take a risk in the ring
And feel the thrill of applause!
If you reach
For the moon
If you aim
For the star
Then the moon
And the sky
Can be yours --
Come on and try!
There's a prize
To be won
Take a risk
Take a ride
Right this way
Have a go
Try your luck --
And step inside!
If you reach
For the moon
If you aim
For the star
Then the moon
And the sky
Can be yours --
Come on and try!
Take the journey of a lifetime!
It's only just a drum-roll away!
On the journey of a lifetime
Every day's a high-wire day!
If you've got what it take
The star and streamer are yours!
Take a risk in the ring
And feel the thrill of applause!

Take a risk
Take a ride
Right this way
Have a go
Try your luck --
And step inside!
Love and your
World can become
A madhouse
Love and your
World can become
A circus
Love turn around
Jenny your
Love is a
Drug that I dare
Not take a
Drug to make me mad
Rose I'd never
Harm the girl
Love
Has turned my
World around
And my
World now turn round
Alex
Love should not
Be used a a weapon
Why Alex
Why can't you
See it's George you're...?
Breaking
And burning
Breaking
And bleeding
In the name of
Love
Love is a
Knife It's a curse
A cancer
To love is to
Hate letting
Go
Jenny I can
Never share your
Love
And I'm falling
I am suddenly falling
And my story
Is older than the star
Suddenly falling
I can feel myself falling
Down into this
Madhoise
Of love
Suddenly falling
I can feel myself falling
In this
Madhouse of
Love
Come on Jenny 
That's enough now 
Jenny even mermaid 
Have to sleep
I am a mermaid 
With golden hair
Come on Jenny 
Be a good girl
Alex let me hold you 
There's so much I want to say
I want you here forever 
In my arm and in my life 
To belong to you entirely 
You know we're not just cousin
We are just cousin Jenny 
And you're fifteen year old
It's not a if I don't know passion 
From living in our house 
I've learnt that feeling can run deep
We'll talk tomorrow -- 
Go to sleep
Taking more 
Than I ought to take
What are you doing? 
Don't even think it 
You have no right to feel this way 
And yet 
I love her and I must not love her 
I wish to God we'd never met 
She ought to be 
The last one I should think of
I know he's 
Up there with her now
She ought to be 
The last one I should love
If he is 
My God I'll kill him
She ought to be 
The last one I should care for
I should have 
Stopped this long ago
The very last
Selfish little cradle-snatcher 
Twisted rotten heartless monster 
Filthy filthy callous bastard
I wa right 
He's in there 
There he is 
He's in there
Jenny my Jenny 
I can't let him take you 
I
George...George
I wa saying goodnight to Jenny 
When I heard a noise in the passage
He must have fallen 
And had a heart attack
No it's hopeless
He wa listening -- 
Jenny mustn't know 
If she asks you 
Say he died while sitting by the fire -- 
Help me to move him in there
George wa an original man
He did not want to change human life
He rejoiced in the way we are made
He rejoiced in the way we are made
He did not look forward to heaven --
He wa happy with the earth
He loved and understood
The flesh food wine love
He lived for today and firmly believed
If death were given a voice
That voice would scream through the sky
Live while you may for I am coming
So
Hand me the wine and the dice
I want my carnival now
While I have thirst and lust for living!
So gather all you can reap
Before you're under the plough --
The hand of death is unforgiving!
Hand me the wine and the dice
While there are grape on the vine --
Life is a round of endless pleasures!
The end is always in sight
But it taste better with wind --
Why pay your life in tiny measures?
Hand me the wine and the dice
The time is racing away --
There's not a taste that's not worth trying!
And if tommorow it end
I won't have wasted today --
I will have lived like I am dying
What wa that?
What?
There 
Listen
There's nothing there I suppose it must have been a rat
So what do you propose to do then? 
Get married while she's still at school? 
Tell her now 
Don't be cruel
There ha to be a way to say it 
Common sense can be so cold
Common sense 
Says be bold
Yes it's a crime to make her love me -- 
But surely it's just a bad to leave her 
And yet that can be the only answer -- 
The whole damn thing's got out of hand
The only crime that I'm aware of 
Would be to let our moment die -- 
Tell her now 
Tell her why
A memory of a happy moment 
That's what this time will one day be -- 
Tell her that 
Then you're free
Will you still be here when I get back?
Yes But don't be too long Alex Don't be too long
Anything but lonely
Anything but empty room
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is there?
Anything but lonely
Anything but only me
Quiet year in too much space
That's the thing that's hard to face
And
You have a right to go
But you should also know
That I won't be alone for long
Long day with nothing said
Are not what lie ahead --
I'm sorry but I'm not that strong
Anything but lonely
Anything but passing time
Lonely's what I'll never be
While there's still some life in me
And
I'm still young don't forget
It isn't over yet --
So many heart for me to thrill
If you're not here to say
How good I look each day
I'll have to find someone who will
Anything but lonely
Anything but empty room
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is
there...?
Just promise one thing
All right
What is it?
Don't ask me question
You must promise first
I can't
I must know what it is
Don't leave me!
