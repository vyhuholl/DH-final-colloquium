            Til I Hear You Sing       
            The day start the day end
Time crawl by
Night steal in pacing the floor
The moment creep
Yet I can?t bear to sleep
Till I hear you sing

And week pas and month pas
Seasons fly
Still you don?t walk through the door
And in a haze
I count the silent day
Till I hear you sing once more

And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing but the empty air

And year come and year go
Time run dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul
Can?t be alive and whole
Till I hear you sing once more

And music your music
It tease at my ear
I turn and it fade away and you?re not here

Let hope pas let dream pas
Let them die
Without you what are they for?
I?ll always feel
No more than halfway real
Till I hear you sing once more

Did you hear the crowd the way they cheered I hope you're proud
Did you like the new routine? Was it passable I mean
I can change a thing or two what should I do?
No don't say it I can guess but I promise I'll progress

The Phantom Yes of course Whatever you feel is best

Meg Did the costume look okay? Too revealing would you say?
People seemed to like the view

Madame Giry Meg please

Meg I could show a bit more skin that would sure bring 'em in --

Madame Giry Meg! Can't you see that the master's at work?
Can't you see that his mind's somewhere else?
Can't you see that obviously he's thinking of thing more important than you?

The Phantom Careful Madame You're forgetting yourself

Madame Giry Don't you see he forgot what this is?
Opening day a big deal what a fuss
Our success mean not I guess compared to the thing that the Master must do!

The Phantom That's quite enough!

Madame Giry Christine! Christine

Meg Christine

Madame Giry Meg leave Now!
In Paris when the mob surrounded you who wa there? We were there
Where wa she when the low men hounded you? Gone long gone We stayed on
Who concealed you safe away? Smuggled you up to Calet? Found a freighter out of France?

The Phantom I don't see the problem This is ancient history

Madame Giry And once here when the side show hired you who stood by? Meg and I
While they kept you on display who kept working night and day?
Who gave you their very lives?
And who helped you buy that side show?
Who helped you finance you scheme? Who wouldn't quit 'till your act wa a hit?
And your hit could become your dream?
Who played the politician lured investor and the press? No not her
And who stayed with you helped you and advised you?
We stayed with you loved and idolized you
She betrayed you shunned you and despised you!
She chose Raoul chose his beauty and youth
It's long past time you faced --

The Phantom Enough! You'll be repaid a I promised you would Now if you've anything else left to say

Oh Christine my Christine yes you've fled from my face once before

            Look With Your Heart       
            [Christine]
Love's a curious thing it often come disguised
Look at love the wrong way it go unrecognized

So look with your heart and not with your eye
The heart understands the heart never lie
Believe what it feel and trust what it show
Look with your heart the heart always know
Love is not always beautiful not at the start

So open your arm and close your eye tight
Look with your heart and when it find love your heart will be right

Learn from someone who know make sure you don't forget
Love you misunderstand is love that you'll regret

This whole arrangement bear your stamp you're in each measure of that song
How dare you try and claim me now? How dare you come invade my life?

Oh Christine my Christine in that time when the world thought me dead
My Christine on that night just before you wed ah Christine
You came and found where I hid don't you deny that you did that long ago night

[Christine]
That night

[Phantom]
Once there wa a night beneath a moonless sky
Too dark to see a thing too dark to even try

[Christine]
I strode to your side to tell you I must go
I couldn't see your face but sensed you even so
And I touched you

[Phantom]
And I felt you

[Phantom and Christine]
And I heard those ravishing refrain

[Christine]
The music of your pulse

[Phantom]
The singing in your vein

[Christine]
And I held you

[The Phantom]
And I touched you

[Christine]
And embraced you

[Phantom]
And I felt you

[The Phantom and Christine]
And with every breath and every sigh

[Christine]
I felt no longer scared

[Phantom]
I felt no longer shy

[Phantom and Christine]
At last our feeling bared
Beneath a moonless sky

[Christine]
And blind in the dark a soul gazed into soul
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole

[Phantom]
Cloaked under the night with nothing to suppress
A woman and a man no more and yet no le
And I kissed you

[Christine]
And caressed you

The Phantom and Christine And the world around u fell away
We said thing in the dark we never dare to say

[The Phantom]
And I caught you

[Christine]
And I kissed you

[Phantom]
And I took you

[Christine]
And caressed you

[Phantom and Christine]
With a need too urgent to deny
As nothing mattered then except for you and I
Again and then again beneath a moonless sky

[Phantom]
And when it wa done before the sun could rise
Ashamed of what I wa afraid to see your eye
I stood while you slept and whispered a good-bye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky

[Christine]
And I loved you yes I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you led
I woke to swear my love and found you gone instead

[The Phantom]
And I loved you

[Christine]
I loved you

[Phantom]
And I left you

[Christine]
How I loved you

[Phantom]
And I had to both of u knew why

[Christine]
We both knew why

[Phantom and Christine]
And yet I won't regret from now until I die
A night I can't forget beneath a moonless sky

[Phantom]
And now

And maybe I wa wrong but now the moment's gone
Were it still that other time I'd make time itself somehow bend
But now I'm not that strong and time keep moving on

            The Phantom Confronts Christine       
            Christine Gustave! It's alright it's me! Gustave Please take him away
I'm so sorry please forgive him He meant no harm

The Phantom How could you think I wouldn't guess?

Christine What do you mean?

The Phantom How could you think I wouldn't know?

Christine Oh no

The Phantom Do you have something to confess?

Christine Please don't make me!

The Phantom I want the truth right now if so!

Christine Once upon another time you went off and left me alone
But that's not all you did You left me with a son
Ever since that other time I wish how I wish you'd have known
I kept the secret hid the secret my marriage forbid
What else could I have done?
Just love

The Phantom A son

Christine Just live

The Phantom My son

Christine Just give what I can give and take what little I deserve

The Phantom My own flesh and blood and even he recoil in horror from me Just like his mother

Christine Forgive me I beg you if you can
I've brought you nothing but woe
Tomorrow night I'll sing with all my heart
Sing for you again!
Then we'll go

The Phantom From out of ugliness such light
From out of darkness such a flame
In him my wrongness is made right
And yet he loathes me all the same

So let him shun me in disgust
Let him flee this cursed face
If I must hide from him I must
Yet shall he be my saving grace

For Christine my Christine
If it's true I've no reason to live
Then Christine then a boy shall have all I can give
Ah Christine
All I create on this earth
All that I'll never be worth
All shall be his!

Madame Giry Ten long year and he cast u aside
Ten whole year this is how we're repaid
Ten dark year of toil and tear
And now what we've worked for will go to that child!

All our hope were at last in our grasp
All the dream and the plan that we laid
Everything is vanishing
And we get discarded rejected reviled

All of the bond in between is now torn
All of the love that we gave him forsworn
All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!

Raoul spoken
Yes what to do with me
That's the question isn't it? That's always been the question Ever since the beginning

Raoul(sung
She look for sympathy
I give her sorrow
She asks for honesty
I've none to borrow
She need my tender kiss
She begs it of me
I give her ugliness
Why doe she love me?

She yearns for higher thing
Things I can't give her
The rush the music brings
I can't deliver
And even when she sings
And soar above me
I try to clip her wing
Why doe she love me?

One more drink sir
That's what I need don't you think sir?
Leave the hurt behind

spoken Didn't you hear me?
Another drink!

sung She want the man I wa
Husband and father
At least she think she doe
She needn't bother

Beneath this mask I wear
There's nothing of me
Just horror shame dispair
Why doe she love me?

How about you sir?
Tell me what am I to do sir
Leave the hurt behind

Meg

Raoul

Meg

Raoul

Meg
Around here they call it Suicide Hall Its where people end up when they don't know where else to go The hopeless the
desperate It's a good place to step off the side of a pier and quietly vanish

Raoul
You seem to be a regular?

Meg
Me? I come here to swim

sung This town is coarse and cold and mean
It's hard to keep your conscience clean
Faceless in the crowd
Anythings allowed
And so I come at dawn each day
Come to wash it all away
Sink into the sea
Blue and cool and kind
Let it set me free
Let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind

spoken
Meg
You should never of come to America
It's not a place for people like you and Christine It's too easy to forget who you are and where you belong That's why
mother say you must leave here Now Take your wife and the boy and go

Raoul
Leave? But what about tonight? The concert the money Am I to just run away? From him?

Meg
When the sun rise tomorrow we can all start again Clean

sung Sail across the sea
Put u out of mind
Close your eye and flee
Let yourself stay blind

            Heaven By The Sea Reprise       
            All It's the last day of the season
And there ain't a single cloud
What a day to leave the city on a spree
Away from all the hustle and the bustle and the crowd
On a little slice of heaven by the sea

It's the last day of the season to indulge
Forget the factory and the scrum
To be rested and relaxed and fancy free
One day more then back to work
To flee from all the bother and the hassle and the noise

Man With your lady

Woman And your fella

Couple And your kid and your umbrella

All On a little slice of heaven by the sea
The surf the sand the breeze the food
The peace and calm the restful mood
Amid the sea and spray
The city fall away
The sun the sun the sea the sea the salty air
The mile the mile of beach of beach with room to spare

Man And the pretzel

Woman And the custard

Man 1 And the girls!
Man 2 The francs!
Man 3 The mustard!
Woman 1 And the tanning!
Woman 2 And the lotion!
Woman 3 And the pier
Man 1 The beer
Man 2 The ocean

Woman And the oyster

Man And the pickle

Man 2 And the knocker

Man 3 And the steamer

All It's a little slice of heaven by the sea

What a treat to get away
From the frantic and the fray
All the cluster and the fuss

To this placid little beach
Far beyond the city's reach
And it's only for u

What a joy to convalesce
From the city's wild excess
And forget it all like thus

On this sheltered little slice
Of a seaside paradise

It's the last day of the season
So relax and have a beer
Hurry up the summer's almost over

            Christine
Who know when love begin who know what make it start
One day it's simply there a life inside your heart
It slip into your thought it infiltrates your soul
It take you by surprise then seizes full control
Try to deny it and try to protest
But love won't let you go once you've been possessed

Love never dy love never falter
Once it ha spoken love is yours
Love never fails love never alters
Hearts may get broken love endures
Hearts may get broken love endures

And soon a you submit surrender flesh and bone
That love take on a life much bigger than your own
It us you at whim and drive you to despair
And force you to feel more joy than you can bear
Love give you pleasure and love brings you pain
And yet when both are gone love will still remain

Once it ha spoken love is yours
Love never dy love never alters
Hearts may get broken love endures
Hearts may get broken

Love never dy love will continue
Love keep on beating when you're gone
Love never dy once it is in you
Life may be fleeting love life on
Life may be fleeting
Love life on

How to make you watch
Well watch me now

I took a little trip to Coney Island
I took a little trip because of you
I did a Mother said and followed where you led
And tried to do what little I could do

Well here's the way it work on Coney Island
They make you pay for every little crumb
I gave what they would take I gave it for your sake
Now look at me and see what I've become

Bathing beauty on the beach
Bathing beauty in her dressing room
Bathing beauty in the dark
On their lap in their arm in their bed

Meg my little Meg
What are you saying?

Who helped you raise the money?
Who helped the permit come through?
Who greased the wheel of your high flying deal
Bought you time when the bill came due?

Who swayed the local boss
Curried favor with the press?
No not her
And who kept singing desperate for your favor
Who kept dancing hoping you would save her
Who kept dying and this is what you gave her

Now that I've got your attention at last
Here's the big finish and then you can go

Give me the gun Meg
Give me the hurt and the pain and the gun Meg
Give me the blame for not seeing the thing
That you've done Meg

Give me the gun Meg
Give me the chance to see you clear at last
See me clear at last
You feel ugly you feel used
You feel broken you feel bruised

Ah but me I can see all the beauty underneath
Yes
You've been robbed of love and pride
Been ignored and pushed aside
Even so I still know there is beauty underneath
Yes

Diamonds never sparkle right
If they aren't set just right
Beauty sometimes go unseen
We can't all be like Christine

Christine Christine
Always Christine

No I didn't mean to
Mother there say something
Say anything
Giry go get help now

Where's Papa?
He should be here
Where's Papa?
Your father your real father

Look with your heart and not with your eye
The heart understands the heart never lie
Believe what it feel and trust what it show
Look with your heart the heart always know

Love is not always beautiful
Not at the start
So open your arm
And close your eye tight
Look with your heart
And when you find love

No

Once upon another time our story had only begun
I had a taste of joy the most I ever knew
Now there isn't any time and somehow our story is done
And what about the boy what am I to do?

Just love just live
And give what we can give
And take the love that you deserve
Just love just live
And give all that I have
And take what little I deserve

Come closer I beg you
Closer still
Remember love never dy
Kiss me one last time
