            Prologue       
            A railway cutting A wild stormy summer night The Signal Man is in his signalbox
He receives a message from down the line He wire back a message
We hear the strange,eerie singing of the wire
From the gloom we see a figure of a man-Walter Hartright
He is about 30 year of age,attractive,dark,open
He carry a bag and an easel
He see the Signal Man checking the track with his lantern below him

HARTRIGHT:Hallo! Below there! Hallo!
A lightning flash
HARTRIGHT:Signal Man? Down there...Hallo!
Pause
SIGNAL MAN:Who call to me in the dead of the night?
Walter step out of the shadow into the light of the Signal Man's lantern
HARTRIGHT:Hartright My name is Walter Hartright
He climb down to the Signal Man's level
SIGNAL MAN:What are you doing here on a night like this?
HARTRIGHT:I'm lost sir I'm trying to find my way to Limm'ridge
House-The train broke down and I'm forced to walk
SIGNAL MAN:Branch train broke down-what you say is true
HARTRIGHT:Yes,I heard the wire singing in the wind-The noise of them led me to you
SIGNAL MAN:Why are you going to Limm'ridge House?
HARTRIGHT:I have the post of drawing master-I must arrive tonight for I start tomorrow
Sir you look upon me with such dread
Pause
SIGNAL MAN:Last night I had a vision
That a stranger would appear
He stood right where you are-
A man such a yourself
Alarm on the line! he said
Alarm on the line!
So I tapped out the message
And the answer came back
All well both way
But he said You'll mark my word
When a year to this day
The dead lie on the tracks!
The dead lie on the tracks!
HARTRIGHT:I can assure you sir,I know of no imminent danger!
SIGNAL MAN:A man such a yourself!
Suddenly there is a strange sound in the air The telegraph wire sound again in the signal box
SIGNAL MAN:There calling me from the down the line There's danger somewhere along the line
The sound of the wire grows to a terrible pitch
From behind Hartright,from the depth of the tunnel a hand reach out and touch him on the shoulder
It is a woman dressed in white(Anne Catherick
She is in her early 20's,fair,attractive,but her face is drawn and sorrowful
Her manner is wild and insistent
HARTRIGHT:(startled)Oh my God!
ANNE:You've got to help me!
There's someone after me!
HARTRIGHT:How can I help you?
ANNE:I'm being followed and I've done nothing wrong!
HARTRIGHT:It's very late for you to be out here alone-
ANNE:You must believe me that I am free from blame
HARTRIGHT:Who do you run from?
ANNE:I dare not say his name!
HARTRIGHT:Where do you live?
I'll try to help you if I can
ANNE:I have a secret
My precious secret
But can I trust you?
But can I trust you?
Her tone change She reach out to him
ANNE:They cannot take away my secret-
thought it's something I can't share with you
It's locked inside my heart,my secret-
but there's someone I must tell it to
Secrets kept inside can hurt you
mine is sharper than a knife
If I tell the one I seek
I may save her life
She is in distress
HARTRIGHT:Please you needn't fear me
truly you can trust me
I would never harm you
I'm no threat-I am Walter
Walter Hartright I'll help you to get home
ANNE:I've no home at all
nothing but my secret I have just my secret
Hartright reach out and gently take her hand
The noise of a pony and chaise approaching She break away
ANNE:There's someone coming!
And I must get away-
I have to get away!
But can I trust you?
She move off toward the tunnel
HARTRIGHT:Don't go in there!
He said there's danger on the line
ANNE:(echoing)I'll tell my secret for secret must be told
She disappears back into the tunnel A servant enters
SERVANT:You must be Mister Hartright?
HARTRIGHT:Yes
SERVANT:I'm sent to bring you straight to Limm'ridge House
HARTRIGHT:Did you see her?
A woman,dressed in white
SERVANT:I saw no one
HARTRIGHT:A woman all in white?
SERVANT:Sir,I saw no one
I saw no one
The servant pick up Hartright's bag and exit with them
Hartright look around and then exit after him
The light is beginning to dawn on a new day

            Parlour game
limmeridge house The morning room-light and summery
Marian halcombe is there She is in her 30's-dark,vivacious
And attractive although not conventionally pretty
Hartright enters,tired after the night's exertion Marian shake his hand

Hartright:you must be miss halcombe-i'm so sorry-
Marian:(interrupting him
Thank god you have arrived
You're fated to become
My drawing teacher
You poor poor creature
Our village is a dull
As it may first appear
A city mouse in limm'ridge house
I hope you'll like it here

You're le than half the age
That we thought you might be
You'll feed our hunger
For someone younger
So please unpack your bag
And please be of good cheer
I'm sure you'll like where you reside
But with respect i must confide
I can't abide the countryside
I hope you'll like it here

You shall be the drawing master
To my sister and to me
Though she learns a little faster
A disaster i will be
We're the product of one mother
But we come from diff'rent father
I think mine,for design
Was completely talent free

Very soon you'll meet my sister
Well,she's tech'nic'ly my half
But she's my whole world-my sister
Is the wheat and i'm the chaff
She's kind and generous and fun
Much younger and the pretty one!

My father wa quite poor
Her father's wealth wa vast
So she'll inherit and gladly share it
We're close a two can get
Between u not one tear
Perpetually in harmony
I hope you'll like it here

Pretty soon you'll meet my uncle
Whose prognosis is quite grim
He will tell you that his chance
Of recovery are slim
With his bed pan and his hanky
He is terminally cranky
Though no doctor around
Found a thing that's wrong with him

But how i do go on
I try to keep it short
Then lose the battle and simply prattle
But getting to the point
My welcome is sincere
We're thrilled that's indisputable
I hope your room are suitable
Your sentence is commutable
I hope you'll like it here

A servant arrives and escort hartright to mr fairlie's dark study

mr fairlie sits beside a portrait of hsi brother-philip fairlie
Mr fairlie is in his fifty but look older,he is frail,morose,pale,crabby,wheelchair-bound

Servant:mr walter hartright
Hartright:mr fairlie!
mr fairlie look hartright up and down
Mr fairlie:you're than i thought
The young are mostly fool
The good time cease when with my niece
Just go about your task
And try to disappear
to the servant
Don't lurk about you oafish lout
to hartright)i trust you'll like it here
he gesture to the portrait
That's a portrait of my brother
Was the picture of good health
Now he's dead and i am dying
While i'm living...on his wealth
Up until he left for hades
He wa catnip to the lady
But at least the deceased had a modicum of stealth
Well enough about my fam'ly
to servant)would you please adjust my chair?
to hartright)i should send you back to ripen
Like a proper camembert
Thought i should find some other chap
I'd much prefer to take a nap
to servant who reappears
I told you to get out!
I simply can't go on
My nerve are fraying
What wa i saying?
Oh,mostly i desire
A quiet atmosphere
As silent a a sepulchre
No utterance above a purr
Just nod your head
If you concur
I trust you'll like it here

            Perspective       
            The conservatory Marian enters

Marian
Is she not the way that I described her?
We're a unalike a black and white

Laura
Still we are insep'rable

Marian
Joined a day to night
Very clearly of a diff'rent feather-
We're an odd but merry pair of birds!
She'd say I'm verbose and garrulous-

Laura
But in fewer words!

Marian
Laura!

Laura to Hartright
I fear your journey here wa tedious?

Hartright
My journey wa filled with drama!
First I met the local Signal Man- a strange and
Unearthly man He told me he'd had a vision that I
Would come and that I would bring tragedy in my wake

Laura
Heavens!

Hartright
Indeed!
But he said ?You'll mark my words!
When a year to this day
The dead lie on the tracks!
The dead lie on the tracks!?

Marian
How strange!

Hartright
What happened next wa stranger still
A woman breathless and afraid
Appeared out of the night!
Completely dressed in white
She had a secret she would tell
Of one who had mistreated her
Her face and frightened gaze
My mind cannot erase?
But then she ran from view
to Laura She looked so much like you

Laura
Perhaps you saw a ghost?

Hartright
Ghost or not she haunt me still
She looked so much like you?
Marian
We must clear up this mystery!

Hartright
But first lady we must take
Advantage of this wonderful light!

A beautiful summer's day for their first drawing lesson
They are outside in the formal garden of Limmeridge House with a couple of servant all three
before their easel drawing We hear both what they express openly and their inner thought

Marian
Nothing's duller than my watercoloring
I've next to no technique at all

Laura
My pen and ink are passable

Marian
My pen and ink appall
All my sketching soon will have you retching
I'm a notch below a chimpanzee

Laura
But we're highly trainable

Marian
We shall wait and see

Hartright
You can capture shade and light
Best of all perspective

Marian All I ever do is tright

Hartright
Beauty is subjective
You'll develop your own style

Marian
He ha such a winning smile

Hartright
You will know when it feel right

Laura
I could trust him at first sight

Hartright
Be observant be a humble servant
Solely dedicated to your art

Laura
I can hardly concentrate

Marian
What a shaky start

Hartright
Don't conceal the thing you think and feel
Get your emotion flowing through your brush

Marian
If I follow your advice
You would surely blush

Laura
If I practiced what you preach
I'd be more effective

Hartright gazing at Laura
She's so clearly out of reach
Seen from my perspective

Marian
He's a breath of summer air

Hartright
See the sunlight in her hair

Laura
I must disregard his charm

Laura and Marian
And his manly rugged arm

Marian
Give me people not a tree or steeple
Not a slice of apple and a knife
Still life's not a int'resting
As a slice of life

Hartright looking at Marian's drawing
You're improving this is very moving
That's a cocker spaniel clear and true

Marian
Thank you for the compliment
I wa sketching you!

All Three
What's the reason I am here?
What is my objective?
What a stirring atmosphere!
But where is my perspective?

Can you get a dizzy thrill?
While the world is standing still?
Yet the summer's drifting by
While these golden moment fly

            Trying Not to Notice       
            We are now in wilder couldtryside It is hot
Collars are undone shawl are abandoned
Hartright start to sketch laura


Marian

Sweet tension fill the air
Which i know i ought not dwell upon
I look away and still see him there
I'm trying not to notice him
Yet i can't help but stare

Hartright

No gazing!
Know your place
Words that i'd be wise to tell myself!
I close my eye and i still see her face
I'm trying not to notice her
But i don't stand a chance

Laura

I'm trying not to notice him
Yet i return each glance
A thousand contradiction
Are stirring in my soul
They seem to grow in me
Overflow in me

Hartright

In spite of my conviction
I'm losing my control

Marian

I'm slightly shocked inside
Keep it locked inside

All three

Unspoken
Unexpressed
Still it's louder than a symphony
Can no one hear what my heart seems to shout?
Perhaps they do not notice it
Though it's a plain a day
I'm trying not to notice it
But it won't go away

the end of the lesson Marian and laura gather up their brush and paint
They go to exit-laura realizes that she ha forgotten something
She return to where hartright is They both linger for a moment

            Hartright

Whenever i look at you
The world disappears
All in a single glance so revealing
You smile and i feel a though
I've known you for year
How do i know to trust what i'm feeling?

I believe my heart
What else can i do
When ev'ry part of ev'ry thought
Leads me straight to you

I believe my heart
There's no other choice
For now whenever
My heart speaks
I can only hear your voice

Laura

The lifetime before we met
Has faded away
How did i live a moment without you?
You don't have to speak at all
I know what you'd say
And i know every secret about you

I believe my heart
It belief in you
It's teling me
That what i see
Is completely true
I believe my heart
How can it be wrong
It say that what i feel for you
I will feel my whole life long

Both

I believe my heart
And it belief in you
It's telling me
That what i see
Is completely true

And with all my soul
I belive my heart

Hartright I wa down but rarely out of spirit
You'd have found me in a Holborn drinking den

Marian Then it's safe to say you value your position?

Hartright More than anything at all

Marian Since we both were child
Laura sometimes sleepwalks
I would wake and find her
On the stair unaware of how she got there
More than her half sister

And I must protect her

Hartright What reason do you tell me this?

Marian I know sir what your secret is

Hartright I have no secret here

Marian My sister is engaged!
To a man of sterling character
A titled man of property-
A man her father chose

Hartright What?

There can be no hope of any attachment
No hope of any future I'm sorry if this hurt you

Of medicine
No opera star
with passion My voice is thin

I have in spade
Is one for fun
And escapade
A gift for living well
Attracted to the lively art
Breaking bread breaking heart

He look at Marian

Making love when love ha me spellbound

He take some wine from a servant fill his glass

Italian food
The wine of France
I never walk when I can dance

A small pirouhette for the lady

A gift for living well

A one man band
I sing the lead
Alwasy self-accompanied

He play a few chord on the piano

I concede probably I'm hellbound

A bon vivant
As you can see
A lust for life a big a me!
A gift for living well

Fosco But enough about me! Raise your glass

Fosco raise his glass to the bride and groom

Hartright suddenly interrupt the toast - address Sir Percival Glyde

Hartright  Please let me speak
And forgive my interruption
Please hear me out
On a very pressing matter
One that concern a girl
Her name is Anne Anne Cath'rick
She say you've done her wrong
Have you an explanation?

Mr Fairlie What impertinence! Mr Hartright know your place sir!

Glyde No no Mr Fairlie I am glad that he asked this Please please
I am happy to clear up the matter of Anne Catherick

Glyde Her tale is truly sorrowful
And some would say a tragedy
Her story break my heart
I don't know where to start
Her mother wa in my employ
to Mr Fairlie Your brother recommended her
Recall she worked here too?

Mr Fairlie Catherick? I'm not sure that I do

Glyde Anne wa so sweet a an infant
She used to laugh all the time
She sparkled like the sun
Such a pretty one
Yet she grew up so unhappy
Sullen and angry and sad
She wa a troubled child
Acting strange and wild
She once attacked her mother
When she wa just sixteen
A fury with no pause
No one knew the cause
To help her grieving mother
And rescue Anne herself
I undertook her care
I tried to see her through
It wa the Christian thing to do

When no physician could treat her
I found a haven that would
A trusted private place
To embrace her case
Anne think of me a her captor
When I am truly her friend
For all her care I pay
Still she run away

Fosco who appears moved by the story shake Glyde by the hand

Fosco I'm touched by your compassion
Your kindness know no bound

Glyde I've done the best I can
I've done my best for Anne

Once again Hartright speaks up

Hartright She spoke sir of a secret
A secret she would tell

Glyde Her world ha come to be utter fantasy
But her safe return
Is my great concern
And I am grateful for
Your help

Laura Poor Anne
Her story saddens me

Marian Yet it explains the mystery

Fosco Had it not been for Glyde
I'm sure she would have died

Mr Fairlie No more please!
Neither Anne Catherick nor her silly mother are any of your business sir
And once more my nerve are quite shot

Fosco Then a shot of brandy is what I prescribe Signor!

Mr Fairlie Yes let u retire at once to my study gentleman

Glyde Fosco and Mr Fairlie leave  Glyde bow his thanks again to Hartright

Glyde Thank you sir

Hartright is left with the two woman

Hartright I don't believe him
Can't you see he's clearly lying
As for your uncle
It's the truth that he's denying

Marian Sir you must leave at once
You must go right away

Laura But Marian-

Marian What reason ha he to lie?
How can you hope to stay here?

Laura Please Marian-

Marian  Laura our future is settled
Soon you'll be Lady Glyde
You'll have a perfect life
As that fine man's wife
He is a man of compassion
Look how he helped that poor girl
He ha integrity
He's all a man should be!

Laura look to Hartright

Hartright I clearly don't belong here
Your sister is quite right
I leave for London now!

Laura run out upset

Hartright to Marian Are you happy now?

He exit  Marian left alone crumples begin to cry

Marian I close my eye and I still see his face

She exit

Lady Laura Glyde
Lady Laura Glyde
The church bell are ringing
They call out to warn you
But even my warning were too late to save you
Now your fate is sealed
How can he be stopped?
You'll be the lady of Black Water House
All the room filled with sorrow
The lake filled with tear drop
Where you're at his mercy and he know no mercy
I can't let this come to pas
I can't let you suffer a I did
I must journey to your side
So unlike me
You won't be friendless
So unlike me you won't be friendless


Welcome to your new home Lady Glyde!
Laura what is it?
Laura!
Something is wrong!


She is just tired


No I Must go to her!


Oh she will calm down
You live in her shadow!


If I do
Then It is because I am comfortable there


She is lovely
But you Miss Halcombe
Are beyond All compare


Leave me alone
I don't need your help!


Laura you know you can trust me
Please let me know what is wrong
We seem so far apart and it break my heart!


Trust you? Now why should I trust you?
When your advice led me here
Straight from the wedding prayer to complete despair!
He only want my money!
That's all he want from me!
Though he's a barronet
He is steep in debt
I'll show you how he love me!
I think you'd want to see
His love is on display
A mark for every day'
You said he's all a man should be!

Wide awake in your arm

Tous off

All thanks oh Lord to thee
I pray thee now that sinless the hour of dark may be
Though many are the peril through which I have to go
Oh Lord keep me in thy sight
And guard me through the coming night

The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the tree that are in the wood
The holly bear the crown
O the rising of the sun

And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ

Sweet singing in the choir

Sing for it's Lammastide

If we'll live till the spring

            COUNT FOSCO

Miss Halcombe
It is behatch
I'm so terribly sorry
There is no easy way to say this
Your sister
She is dead
She wa walking in her sleep


What are you saying! sobbing


She had sent her maid away
As is her custom I understand
She walked to her window
And she fell from a great height you see
It's a tragic accident
I am so deeply sorry
I am leaving for London today
If you need anything
Anything at all
This is where you'll find me

PRIEST At the graveyard

I am the life and the resurrection
Said The Lord
Who so ever liveth and believeth in me
Shall never die


How can the good Lord take my love away
Far too young
Far too good
I have to face forever
All without my love
There's no describing my sadness
She wa the light of my life
And life is so unfair
Such a cross to bear
Still there's the will to contend with
All kind of paper to sign
I can't believe she's gone
Yet we must go on

LAURA's UNCLE

How can you talk of business!
Good God it's much too soon!


Of course we'll wait a bit
That's appropriate


I'm much too overcome now
My nerve are simply flayed
Why don't you come to me
In June


Marian
I hope you still think of me a your brother


I don't believe a word
Everything he utters is a lie
I wa powerless
Just a woman!
Too weak to save you!
I have no doubt he murdered you!
Laura!
You were all I had
I can't believe your gone
Where is Walter
He's the only one
You and I can count upon
All for Laura
I will be strong
I will live to right
This wrong

On the Streets of London Walter Hartright pass by a man begging on the street


Spare me a penny
Sir


This is my last one


Then I won't deprive you


Please take it
It's yours

It take some comfort
It'll help you forget sir

            Ever on my mind
Evermore without you
I'll never know a thought or feeling That isn't about you
Nevermore alone
Never to forget you
Not when my life wa changed forever The first time I met you
You're all I know
And though I've lost you
You're someone I can't let go

Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life without you
Or even tomorrow?
Evermore without you
Were we never meant to be?

Nevermore alone
Never to forget you
Not when my life wa changed the first Time I met you
You're all I know
And though I've lost you
You're someone I can't let go

Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life without you
Or even tomorrow?
Evermore without you
Were we never meant to be?

Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life

Evermore without you
We were never meant to be

            Lost soul all of u searching
Never finding what we are seeking
All hope long ago buried
Here in London in a sea of stranger

We're pris'ners in darkness
Rats in a cage
With anger and hunger to fuel our rage
More of the same each bloody day
Best you should stay out of our way

We drink to let go of the life that we know
It's hopeless we're caught in the undertow
Drowning in gin each endless night
Endlessly spoiling for a fight

Can you help me? There's a man I'm searching for
Can you help me? Walter Hartwright is his name

Questions all without answer
And our business is to forget them
Lost soul all of u searching
Here in London in a sea of stranger

We're here to let go of our worry
Fill your bitter cup
No need to look forward or backwards
Only bottom up

Please sir help me? There's a man that I must find
Can you help me? Walter Hartwright is his name

Hartwright? Did you say Walter Hartwright?
Yes I know him I'll take you to him
I know him I'll take you to where he will be
Delighted to help you believe you me

A city with no answer
We're looking for salvation
In endless desperation
With gin to dull our sens
And chase away our demon
And though we'll never find it
We'll drink until we're blinded

Can you find it in your heart
To overlook what i've done
And make another start
Once again
As we were

I am overcome with shame
Will you let me rebuild the bridge I've set aflame
Can we be a we were
If not for me for her

I know that I've wronged you
And that I can't defend
I hope I haven't
That you're my one true friend

With such sadness
We both live
Though it's unpardonable
I ask you to forgive
Can't we be

            Fosco's lodging in London We see him at home in a strange
surreal lair-full of caged animals-birds and mouse He is packing


Time to fly the coop my doves!
Arriverderci Londra! No tear bambino
You must learn to far la bella figura!
Put on a good show!
Always Count Fosco-he put on a good show!

Fosco performs for his animal

My little friend you are all in this world
that I trust
Now we must find a new home and I see you're non plussed
Now that we've won
and we' have all the spoil
We must see that we don't miss the boat
But you'll forgive me if I take a moment to gloat

You can get away with anything
It all come down to style
You'll have a captive
audience
As long a you beguile
Yes you can have your cake and eat it
The love of those whom you betray
But you can't get away with anything
If you don't get away
I admit that I'm a criminal
obsessed with perfect crime
But even one a good a I
can bungle it sometimes
Yes even one who is a genius
can now and then get in a scrape
But no endeavor's a catastrophe
a long a you escape

And we are off! Out that door!

We'll pack our bag my little friend
and leave the scene while we are winner
And long before the story end
a wealthy unrepentant sinner
We all have got a spot of farce in u
but only some of u are larcenous
And few still the divine thrill in u
that come from being truly villainous

You can get away with anything
to prove it is my sport
I live to push the boundary
to break the rule in short
One must be something of a bounder
if one intends to play this game
There's only one thing that one ha to have
one ha to have
no shame
Yes I can get away with everything because I
have no shame

Fosco is pleasantly surprised He shoos the servant away
He slick back his hair back adjusts his smoking jacket
The servant exit a Marian enters


To what Miss Halcombe do we owe this honour?
Each successive day wa getting duller

a she take her coat off revealing her red dress to him for the first time

Well I somehow thought you might be missing me


I must tell you scarlet is your color


I cannot spend all my life in mourning
Though in ev'ry way I miss my sister


Truly you display a healthy attitude



I'm for the first time on my own


Really you need not be alone
One should explore on'es playful side


You are a guide most qualified


I leave in the morning for the continent


In my provincial world I cannot be content


We could lead a life that would be well mis-spent


And I have no doubt that would be thrilling
But ala it seems my glass requires refilling

Fosco take her glass and re-fills it generously-as he doe she quickly
and surreptitiously look on his desk
for the document before hastily arranging herself on the sofa
He hand her the drink


Delicious!

Sir if I remove my shoe would that be shocking?


I'd be breathless a your buckle are undone
I would walk to warsaw just to see your stocking
And to see your shapely ankle I would run


You should know it took great courage for this visit
But I must admit that I am glad that I am here


And that dress you're falling out of is exquisite


Though I'm trembling it is clearly not from fear


It's apparent we were made for one another
We're each others moon and sun we're so well matched
Though my feeling aren't remotely like a brother
We are over twenty-one and unattached


I've been waiting all my life for an adventure


What in truth you have been waiting for is me
Let u begin our minuette


No looking back and no regret
Don't I deserve a life of bliss?

FOSCO intimate

Think of this a the precipice

they kiss


I can open up a world you've only heard of


Introduce me to a life beyond your dream


We'll share secret that we'll never breath a word of
And we'll take pursuit of pleasure to extreme


You and I are willing to defy convention
You're my equal both in joie de vivre and wit
We find another worthy of attention
we don't care what others think of u one bit

they kiss


As a paramour I'm rather out of practice
But I'll rise to this occasion I embrace


But that bard of yours is rather like a cactus
May I save if not my virtue then my face?
Would you kindly shave it off
Do be a darling?


Then i will fly back to your side just like a startling

Fosco leaf to shave

opening drawer etc

she continues to look She find the document read it

MARIAN sotto voce

Please! Yes!

she doe not have time to put the paper back before she hears him approaching
She hids it about her person
Fosco re-enters in the mood for love She sits herself quickly


Now my chin is even softer than a baby
Let's resume this tete a tete from where we were

She edge away from him


Though my heart say yes my head's now saying maybe
And my foot are growing colder and concur

She put on her shoe again


When I left this room were we both not on fire?
We'ren't we both about to give romance a whirl?

She stand up


On reflection I found out I'm
somewhat shy-er
And perhaps I'm not really that kind of girl

Fosco pause look at her intensely


It appears that you have lost your taste for kissing
So I'd appreciate if you'd return what's missing

Wordlessly she give the document back to him He hold onto her a moment


Please Please let me go Please

He doe so


This game is through
You think you win
But think about
What might have been
If you had let romance begin
Instead of hiding
In your shell

One day you'll see
What you have spurned
My precious gift
That you returned
A gift for living well

Your every day
A great event
Living on the continent
Yes it's true
I would have you
spellbound

This game of heart
You gladly trade
For solitaire
with venom and old maid
And so I say fare well


Someday your past will catch you up


Please don't let me keep you

But they told me I wa dreaming!

Underneath a cloud of darkness
Though I told them who I wa
There wa no one who believed me!


Then it wa Anne they buried
Claiming it wa you!

Don't haunt me in this way
Brother I have done your dirty work for far too long
For year i've kept your secret
I've brought up your child
They weren't mine
This ha brought me ill health unhappiness
That's your legacy!
I wanted no part of this


You can't go in there!


We have some pressing questions!


Explain this rude intrusion!


You must tell u who's Anne Cattrick!


Uncle you have got to help us!


I don't know what you speak of


There's no more time for secret


Long ago her mother worked here


We won't leave without an answer


What presumption! Know your place sir!


ALl along you've known the truth sir


Good God Anne Cattrick is dead sir!
She lie in Laura's grave


What nonsense you speak of!
It is Laura who is dead
God rest her soul!
My niece is dead

Music begin to play on the piano It is Laura's song

What witchcraft is this?


Come believe your eye Uncle
I wa placed in the asylum
Anne went to my grave
If you ever loved me Uncle tell me who she wa


Your father loved the lady
Anne's mother wa a pretty one
You can guess the rest
Though you and Anne were born a year apart
You could easily have passed for twin
Save you were wanted
And she wa not


She wa my sister?


Yes


And Glyde killed her


What?


He won't get away with this


I'm afraid he already ha
He's on his way to the Continent
Your estate ha already passed to him
He left just before you arrived


What is this secret my sister spoke of?
Uncle do you know?


I assure you
I know nothing more
I'm sorry


Then it is over
Glyde ha won


We can catch him
We can hit him off
He'll need to take the London train


I'll go with you
Laura you rest here


No! I'll never rest again
We can stop him
I have a plan!
Anne shall haunt him
One last time

            Finale       
            SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE

Hello!
You there!
Signalman!
Where in hell in the damn London train!


I've heard report there's trouble on the line!


That isn't expected!
My business here is over
I must make my connection
And why do you look at me in that way?
I've done nothing wrong!
What is that infernal noise!


It's the wire singing in the wind
They're calling me with news sir
There's danger on the line!


This terrible nosie in my head!
Aahh!
Oh God Anne Cattrick?
This isn't real
This cannot be
You do not exist
Get away from me!


You know why I'm here
And what you must say
So you must confess


Woman Stay away


Tell the truth Percival Glyde!
You'll hear my voice inside your head
For all you're life and when you're dead
You won't be free until you express what you have done
Till you confess
You cannot hide!
You can't go far!
Everywhere you go i'll be where you are!
I know what you've done!
We both know it's true!
Secrets must be told


I'm not afraid of you


Everything you did
Every one will know!


That's all in the past buried long ago


Tell the truth Percival Glyde!
Didn't you use me and hurt me!


You were a beautiful girl
Like none i'd ever seen
You were just fifteen


You and I both know the secret


Something that no one could prove
And who'd believe it's true
From the like of you
You told me you were pregnant
You told me it wa mine
It could have been alive
It deserved to die
I had to drown your bastard
I had no other choice
Before the child wa due
I'd had enough of you
All that remains of your secret
Is buried in Black Water Lake
I watched a your disgrace
Sank without a trace


You beat me and you raped me
And then you drowned my child!
When I wa mad from grief you imprisoned me!
My precious little baby
My heart within my heart
The child I never knew
All because of you!
And then you threw away my life!


Your precious secret's meaningless
No one alive remembers you
And you can save your prayer
For no one truly care
It's just like you were never born
And no one ever mourned for you!

'Anne Cattrick' take off the white veil shielding her face and reveals
that it is truly Laura and not Anne Cattrick


You're wrong!
I mourned for Anne! Anne Cattrick!
And the child of yours that you destroyed!


Laura!


This secret seal your fate forever!
And the charge that you can't avoid!
You have kept u both a prisoner!
But the truth ha set u free
It will lock you up and damn your soul
For all of eternity!


You little witch
You think you can trick me?
Come here!
I killed her
And I can kill you too
And the beauty of it is
No one will ever know
Because you're dead!
You're already dead!

Walter Hartright emerges from his hiding spot and he fight with Percival Glyde


He's over there!
We know exactly what you've done!


You see Glyde we all know what you've done!
You've found your own confession!
The game is over!


The game is never over!


Don't go in there!
He said there's danger on the line!

Sir Percival Glyde run into the dark tunnel where an oncoming train hit and kill him


And a year to the day
The dead lie on the track
The dead lie on the track


You were so brave and now we're free


It seemed like Anne wa there with me
Her spirit wa my guide
My sister by my side


Within I know we'll never part
Her heart beat on within my heart


Go to her right away
That it where to belong!


How can I ask your blessing
With all that we've been through
Our world ha changed


You must find it in your heart
To over look what we've done
And make another start
Once again
As we were
If not for me
For Her


Everypart of every thought
Leads me straight to you


And with all my soul
I believe my heart
The portrait that it paint of you
Is a perfect work of art


I close my eyes!
And I still see his face!

~FIN~
