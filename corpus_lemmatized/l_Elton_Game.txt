            Clean The Kit       
            John
Soon i'm gonna be a man
Be a player not a fan
'Cos that's all i've ever wanted since my life began

Gonna be a soccer star
Maybe drive a fancy car
Build a mansion in the country for my ma and pa

Gotta clean the kit!
I'm so sick of it!

Each day i have to go to school
Have to try to keep my cool
While i study for exam on how to be a fool

It's no wonder i'm annoyed
'Cos the state is overjoyed
Just to teach a poor boy how to join the unemployed

I'm so sick of it
School and cleaning kit

One day i won't have to take it
'Cos i know i'm gonna make it
All i need's a chance and i'll be on my way
Only fool obey the rule
They work all day like stupid mule
I'm busting out of here i'll do it one fine day

I ain't eating shit
Cleaning peoples' kit

Thomas and crony
You're not fit to wear our kit you bastard orange proddy git
We'll tear it off your back and stuff it down your throat
Take our advice or pay the price
We certainly won't warn you twice
The tide ha turned and soon we'll be the one to gloat

You're a sodding brit
Wearing irish kit

Mary
So you're gonna be the man
Not a stupid also ran
Well i've heard a lot of talk about your master plan
I don't think you'll be a star
You ain't gonna go that far
You're all talk and sod all action you're all blah blah blah
Come to term with it
Born to clean the kit

Your life's a farce get off your arse
Take my advice get back in class
Or hang around and moan and groan your life away
'Cos every hunk end up a drunk
Just killing time his prospect sunk
Still claiming that he's gonna bust out one fine day

If the cap'll fit
You'll be wearing it
Stuck here cleaning kit

John
Have no fear the time is near
This boy is busting out of here
I'll be burning brightly once the flame is lit
I'll make my mark light up the dark
Explosions start with just one spark
And then another lad will have to clean my kit

I'm so sick of it
School and cleaning kit

Mary
You're so full of it

John
But one day i'm not gonna take it!

Where we live is god's own country
Though it's dirtier and poorer than he planned
Broken window broken life
Jobless husband weeping wife

It may not look like god's own country
But god is love and i know he love this land
Though it's ragged and it's worn
It's the place where i wa born

The beauty lie within in god's own country
It sleep beneath the soil and 'neath the sand
It's our mother and father our hero and martyr
For god's in the people and people are the land
Each new generation will rebuild the nation
That's how it's been since our history began

Other girl
In the darkness of the night i hear it singing
The whispering of the wind and rain it's song

Both
A sublime eternal tune
To the rhythm of the moon
These ancient chord were formed in the beginning
And they sing to me my country right or wrong
These are song we always sang
No one know when they began

Mary
This fair land is god's own country
And it's catholic and republican and free

Other girl
It's a protestant land made by god's perfect hand
And a protestant country it will always be

Both girl
For ireland is mine and is so for all time
From the atlantic ocean unto the irish sea

Where i live is god's own country
I wa born here and this land belongs to me
It's in our blood and in our bone
It's the place that we call home

The beauty lie within in god's own country

We're happy to die that our people may be free
It is our generation that must cleanse the nation
For our cause is just and we'll answer to history

Pack up and get out of god's own country!
Raise your woman and your child up and flee
Or you'll be buried in the dust
For if you're not you'll bury u

Hard to bear

It's not a game
No fad or fashion
Our kind of love's for
Those who dare

I must be strong
I must be bolder
Cling to my dream and
Never tire

Each love denied
Leaves people colder
New love rekindles
Every fire
I shan't betray my
Heart's desire

Even though we come from different side
We won't hide

I am in love
No one can blame me
Such is my story
And my fate

My kind of love
Will never shame me
My love is stronger
Than their hate
My love is stronger
Than their hate

I shall cling to him with all my might
It's my right

All kind of love
Bring u together
Causes the broken
Hearts to mend

People must love
Now and forever
There's only one love in the end
There's only one love in the end

Have i got all the right information?
Which position doe a girl prefer?
I fear premature ejaculation

Death with honour
Because the weak and the fearful are a social disease
I am stronger!
Insects crawl a man stand tall he ha to risk it all
Men dictate their final fate while fool negotiate
When the battle is over and the last deal is done
Let me tell you
The man with the power will be the man with the gun
He can kill you
You're naive if you believe they'll give you a reprieve
Close your eye to compromise betrayal in disguise
I'd rather die on my foot than live on my knee
Won't surrender!
Because i am my country and my country is me
I'll defend her!

            John
Help me please I'm on my knee I'm dying by degree
Too much pain I'll go insane I want my chance again

I have to go on
Screw up my courage and hold on
To my belief

I have a future
I have a wife and i love her
She share my grief

Prison will not break my heart I'll stand apart from this
I'll remember that i'm loved
I won't be shoved into that dark abyss

Inmates
You're in the dead zone You're utterly alone
Get your allegiance sorted
This is the end zone No seed of hope are sewn
Previous friendship aborted
Now that you're inside boy There's nowhere to hide boy
You could hang yourself we can find a rope
Inside the gate love will turn to hate
You will weep While you sleep Then you'll learn to cope
But without hope
We are your friend and we're all convicted men
Think you can stand apart? Think again
We're all you've got now that you've been left to rot

You're in the death zone Satan sits on his throne
Even the strongest are frightened
This is the dark zone We see in monochrome
Nothing is good or enlightened
Happiness is ended All hope is suspended
We are the damned we are all despised
But this prison ha a key And it's loyalty
You can trust all of u when they beat you down we'll be around
It's all too late you are looking at your fate
This is the place you learn to hate
Hate to survive If you hate you'll stay alive

Anger is learned when free men are interned
It isn't a choice or decision
You started to hate when you walked through the gate
From the moment you entered this prison
It's a pitiful sight men deprived of their right
You must maintain your rage and your fury
Revenge is your aim you must murder and maim
Be your enemy's judge and his jury

You're in the death zone Satan sits on the throne
Even the strongest are frightened

Guard
Line up you bastards!

If this is what we are fighting for if this is the way we begin
With the innocent dying the whole nation cry
If this is how we fight our war i don't want to win

We say that justice is our aim but what doe that justice mean?
Condemned without trial no chance of denial
To cripple men in freedom's name is utterly obscene

If men must die we must ask why
Their murder is not a sin?
Though our cause is just we've betrayed it trust
If this is what we're fighting for i don't want to win

If unity's the thing we crave then who will be unified?
The bitter and grieving no cause to believe in
There'll be one nation in the grave uniting those who've died

Holy war Settling score
Ancient debt to call in
We just loved to kill and we always will
If hatred's all we're fighting for then i don't want to win

But when i go i'm on my own The path i walk i walk alone
I face a bitter world with only memory to guide me

I care more than i have ever cared
Yet i know that i am leaving
You'll be in my heart my whole life through
And all the love i have i leave with you

Mary
You're a father you've a family
Your son need you don't ignore him
Just to fight a war you cannot win

John
I hope my son will be proud of me
When i fight i'm fighting for him
Share the love i leave for you with him

Mary
And so we all must pay the price for such a stupid sacrifice
Don't you understand that this won't end 'til we let it

John
When i'm gone you know i won't be back
Mine's a path that ha no turning
Please believe me what i said wa true
That all the love i have i leave with you

Mary
And all the love i have you take with you

People need love
That's what we live for
Now is the time it's
Not too late

We have to love
Try to forgive more
No child wa ever born
To hate

No child wa ever born
To hate

I will strive for peace with all my might
That's what's right

All kind of love
Bring u together
Causes the broken
Hearts to mend

People must love
Now and forever
There's only one love in the end

Full company
There's only one love in the end
