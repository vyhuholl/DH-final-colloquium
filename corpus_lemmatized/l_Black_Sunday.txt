You must be mistaken
It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday
He's doing some deal up in Baltimore now
I hate it when he's away
You must be mistaken
I'm sure that you are
There's more than one car with sticker on
And lot of young guy wear corduroy pant
And I'd know if he hadn't gone
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well I've got news for you
I knew before
If I'm not mistaken it started last year
I'm not very clear how it began
I noticed a change but I just closed my eye
As only a woman can
No I didn't dig deep
I did not want to know
Well you don't interfere
When you're scared of the thing you might hear
When he's back you think I will end it right there and then?
Well my fair weather friend you're wrong again
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well I've got news for you
I knew before
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well I've got news for you
I knew before
Just what time of night do you call this?
No I'm not alright I have had enough Don't you interrupt
Let me finish I said let me finish
I'm tired of waiting for something to happen
Sorry I can't live like this any longer
I am not a saint I've said this before but you haven't heard
Let me finish this time let me finish
Wait a minute! You'll get your turn
It's not often I get the chance to talk
I forget the last time I saw a person
Fifth Avenue might a well be Mars!
Never thought I would ever say
Keep Manhattan give me Muswell Hill
I'd have had more fun with Neville Braitwaite
That old devil Neville always put me first on occasion
No I don't want a drink!
Not yet
I've rehearsed these next line for age
Why do I feel cold? I suppose it's nerve I don't need a drink
Let me finish I said let me finish
I've had it to here with your business problem
I don't want to dance with your bos once a year
I don't care if the neighbour hear
You always say we British are too reserved
I need a change I must do something new or I will go mad
Not now! Let me finish you'll get your chance to call me a child
We've got to make decision don't touch me get away
Don't you touch me!
This isn't a joke for God's sake stop smiling
Don't run out we won't solve anything that way
Come back can't we sit and talk this thing over?
It's not the end of the world if I lose him
It just might seem so tonight
It's not the end of the world
Nothing like it
I'll soon be the same old me
People get over worse thing
And I'll get over this
In no time at all you can bet I'll be laughing
Well I wouldn't give him the pleasure of seeing me cry
Why should I?
It's not the end of the world to feel lonely
I suppose this feeling go
It's not the end of the world to change rainbow
I'll be fine when I find mine
It's not the end of the world to be free
It's not the end of the world to be me
Mum I've got a lot to tell you
Me and Joe have had a bust up
This will be the last letter with the post mark stamped N.Y
I've met a film producer
Please don't laugh
His name is Sheldon
He's what the people here all call a real together guy
He is off to California
And he want me to go with him
Oh thanks for your last letter
I wa thrilled to hear from you
The picture of the garden are all absolutely lovely
And incidentally Sheldon's mum love Mantovani too
Mum I'm not at all unhappy
One day soon when I am settled
I want you both to come out
You will love it in L.A
I've got to buy some swimsuit
So I must rush down to Macy's
I will write to you again
When I have found a place to stay
I'll walk your dog
You can be the first one in the shower
We'll make love every hour
Beneath your Van Gogh
I'll park the car
I'll whistle while the egg are fryin'
Dance while your shirt are dryin'
Waltz or tango?
Let me move in and let's get this show rolling
I'll talk to your plant
I'll even go bowling
There is nothing I wouldn't do
I'll be the perfect little lady for you
Sheldon Bloom
Make some room
Won't say a word
When you're watching Spencer Tracey
I'll learn to dig Count Basie
Nothing to it
I'll start to jog
If that's what you want to take up
I'll stop wearing make up
I can do it!
When you meditate I promise you I'll be quiet
I won't eat eclair
I'll share your sugar free diet
There is nothing I wouldn't do
I'll be the perfect little lady for you
Pass the key
Sheldon B
No horoscope
You won't ever hear me mention Pisces
There won't be any crisis
You can bet that
I'll give up pork
And I will tune that old viola
Quote thing from Emile Zola
I must get that
I will make you feel well when you feel fluey
Be your analyst when your head's real screwy
There is nothing I wouldn't do
I'll be the perfect little lady for you
Sheldon dear
I like it here
Capped teeth and Caesar Salad
Good old Beverly Hills
With every deal that's done
An award is won
You can rent a car
Or rent a star
Suntans and Sunday brunch
Sprinklers sprinkle away
Careers are being hyped
Before the script are typed
I'll call you back and have a nice day
Capped teeth and Caesar Salad
Spotless Beverly Hills
If someone take a walk
All the neighbour talk
Every man and beast
Came from out East
Egos and valet parking
Newsmen gossip away
If you don't mean a thing
You'll find your phone won't ring
I'll call you back and have a nice day
Hello Mr Stigwood's Office - No I'm afraid he's at a screening If you would like to leave word we'll get right back to you Thank you for calling - Have a nice day
Capped teeth and Caesar Salad
Prime time Beverly Hills
The cost of land's so high
You can't afford to die
When you feel bad there
You dial-a-prayer
Earthquakes and English muffin
Ulcers popping away
It's like a fairy tale
Long a you don't inhale
I'll call you back and have a nice day
You made me think you were in love
You made me think that I wa all you'd need
You made me think you were in love
I could've sworn you'd give the world to be mine
Looked that way
Till you called today
You made me think you were in love
You could've used your charm on someone else
You made me think you were the one
You know I built a lot of dream on your smile
How can you do the thing you do?
Last thing at night you used to call me
Soon a you woke up you called me
I made you laugh and we both liked the same thing
You always looked happy very happy
Whatever you wanted I thought I could give you
I ought to hate you but I want you even more
What did you do it for?
You made me think you were in love
We're both too old to play these kind of game
I should be sorry that I met you
You made me mad but I'm not over you yet
And I don't know
Mum I know you'll think I'm potty
But at last I think I've found him
He's young but he's mature
And you will love him I can tell
He say one day we'll marry
And I don't think I should rush him
But if he get his skate on
We can have some kid a well
There are lot of thing I miss mum
No-one make a normal sandwich
You need Goliath's mouth to eat
The one New Yorkers buy
I long to find a drink
That hasn't got an ice cube in it
And for an English sausage
I swear I would gladly die
Anyway a I wa saying
He just can't sit still a minute
He's not like Neville Braithwaite
This one like to dance all night
He doe a lot of travelling
And when he go I miss him
For once I think it's safe to say
I'm doing something right
If I can let go
I will see you in a week or two
It's late
You better get going
Take care of yourself and call anytime you feel that you're missing me
I can only say what I always say at these goodbye
Come back with the same look in your eye
I know you have your work to do
And I know how much you love me
But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night
If there come a time just remember I'm the kind that cry
Come back with the same look in your eye
Everything we want we find in each other
We would be fool to let love slip away
Everything's so right I'm scared that we might lose it one day
We could never keep thing from one another
You know all the feeling that are in my heart
It's not easy it's not easy
When you have to be apart
So I'll see you in a week or two
It's late
You better get going
You'd think that by now we'd know how to handle this but we never will
When you are away every day I pray that nothing dy and you'll
Come back with the same look in your eye
Funny always thought of you a my girlfriend
I just can't believe you could come in here and say all those thing
Let me finish you must let me finish
Thank you thanks for bringing me up to date dear
Didn't know you knew all the in and out of my private life
Let me finish you must let me finish
Let's talk about you
A minute or two
What tart is your husband keeping?
Where's he sleeping?
Can't you say?
Let's talk about men
You're at it again!
I've heard that you need a bedful
For those dreadful
Games you play
How dare you come in here
Wagging your wicked tongue?
Your cheek are red my dear
You look like you've been stung
I know my life's a mess but I think you're the worst thing in it
Wait a minute
Let's talk about you
Because you never do
You just couldn't wait to blurt out
All that dirt out in my face
Let's talk about pill
And illegal thrill
I hear that the habit's gripped you
And you've tripped to every place
Does it make you feel good
Knowing that I feel bad?
Yes knowing you it would
You must be very sad
You can't know how I feel
But my friend you're about to learn how
It's my turn now
Let's talk about booze
And how much you use
What time do your kid start drinking?
Am I sinking low a you?
Yes he know lot of girl he like his fun
I am glad he's got lot and not just one
How's that fat little man wa it one more affair?
Where are you going why are you running away from me?
Are you absolutely sure you don't want to stay for tea?
Don't write a letter when you want to leave
Don't call me at 3 a.m from a friend's appartment
I'd like to choose how I hear the news
Take me to a park that's covered with tree
Tell me on a Sunday please
Let me down easy no big song and dance
No long face no long look no deep conversation
I know how I want you to say goodbye
Take me to a zoo that's got chimpanzee
Tell me on a Sunday please
Don't want to know who's to blame
It won't help knowing
Don't want to fight day and night bad enough you're going
Don't leave in silence with no word at all
Don't get drunk and slam the door
That's no way to end this
I know how I want you to say goodbye
Find a circus ring with a flying trapeze
Tell me on a Sunday please
I don't want to fight day and night bad enough you're going
Don't leave in silence with no word at all
Don't get drunk and slam the door
That's no way to end this
I know how I want you to say goodbye
Find a circus ring with a flying trapeze
Tell me on a Sunday please
I'm very you you're very me
We seem to go well together
You're very me I'm very you
A perfect match I would say
We mean the world to each other
There are no length that we wouldn't go to
Goes to show you
I'm very you you're very me
We make a great combination
You're very me I'm very you
No one could be
More in tune with me
Like sea and sand like sun and sky
There'll always be you and I
I'm very you you're very me
We are compatible people
You're very me I'm very you
I guess we're two of a kind
I stay away when you're moody
If I don't want to talk you make no fuss
We both know us!
I'm very you you're very me
We're 'bout a close a you can be
You're very me I'm very you
Sometimes we get
Angry and upset
But each fight end the way it should
We both make up very good
I'm very you you're very me
If I wa Jane you'd be Tarzan
You're very me I'm very you
If I am Bonnie you're Clyde
If you're New York then I'm Broadway
If I'm a violin you're Yehudi
Punch and Judy!
I'm very you you're very me
We just can't be separated
You're very me I'm very you
No one ha got
What we two have got
Like P and Q like two and three
You'll always be next to me
Nothing like you've ever known
That's the life I thought that I wa gonna show you
Made you choose her love or mine
That's one 'happy ever after' that I owe you
Married man always looking at your watch
I wanted to spend more time than twelve till two
Loving you and
Nothing like we've ever dreamed
I'd have sworn that wa the life we would be living
We were both expecting more
And we can't give any more than we are giving
Something new that is all it wa you know
It would have been better if we stayed a we
Used to be but
Nothing like you've ever known
That is how I thought all your tomorrow would be
Everyday I look at you
And I stop and think how happy you still could be
've done it again! trust me
If you want something ruined give it to me
Show me a dream and I'll show you a nightmare
I'm not a little girl anymore I keep forgetting that
Whatever I do now is bound to be a mistake
Maybe I expect too much
Sit down there is something I've got to tell you
Don't know how to start you've been very good but it's just no good
Let me finish oh please let me finish
It doesn't make sense u staying together
Yes I know you love me and I love you
We're friend
That's it we're friend
Yes I am ungrateful that's right always thinking of me
You only act your age if that's the age you want to be
Maybe we should both ignore what I'm saying
Have I said too much?
Yes I think I have
Oh why won't you listen?
Just let me finish come back!
Let me finish
Come back can't we sit and talk this thing over?
It's not the end of the world to be free
It's not the end of the world to be me
