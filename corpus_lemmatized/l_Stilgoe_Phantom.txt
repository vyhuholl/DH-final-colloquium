In sleep he sang to me
In dream he came
That voice which call to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
Your My spirit and my your voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is here
Inside my your mind
He's there the phantom of the opera!
Beware the phantom of the opera!1
In all your fantasy you always knew
that man and mystery
Were both in you
And in this labyrinth
where night is blind
the Phantom of the Opera is here
inside my your mind
He's there the phantom of the opera
Sing my Angel of Music
Sing my Angel
Sing for me
Sing my Angel!
Sing for me!
No more talk of darkness
forget these wide-eyed fear
I'm here nothing can harm you
my word will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
let daylight dry your tear
I'm here with you beside you
to guard you and to guide you
Say you love me every waking moment
turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
promise me that all you say is true
that's all I ask of you
Let me be your shelter
let me be your light
you're safe no one will find you
your fear are far behind you
All I want is freedom
a world with no more night
and you always beside me
to hold me and to hide me
Then say you'll share with me one love one lifetime
let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here beside you
anywhere you go let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me one love one lifetime
say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
each night each morning
Say you love me!
You know I do
Love me that's all I ask of you
Masquerade!
Paper face on parade   
Masquerade!
Hide your face
so the world will
never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade   
Masquerade!
Look around -
there's another
mask behind you!
Flash of mauve   
Splash of puce   
Fool and king   
Ghoul and goose   
Green and black   
Queen and priest   
Trace of rouge   
Face of beast   
Faces   
Take your turn take a ride
on the merry-go-round   
in an inhuman race   
Eye of gold   
Thigh of blue   
True is false   
Who is who   ?
Curl of lip   
Swirl of gown   
Ace of heart   
Face of clown   1
Faces   
Drink it in drink it up
till you've drowned
in the light   
in the sound   
But who can name the face   ?
ALL
Masquerade!
Grinning yellow
spinning red   
Masquerade!
Take your fill -
let the spectacle
astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glance
turning head   
Masquerade!
Stop and stare
at the sea of smile
around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadow
breathing lie   
Masquerade!
You can fool
any friend who
ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyr
peering eye   
Masquerade!
Run and hide -
but a face will
still pursue you!1
What a night
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme

Watching u watching them!
And all our fear

Six month
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghost!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast
to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
And may it
splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it
Spoken
A secret engagement
Look your future bride
Just think of it
But why a secret?
What have we to hide?
No Raoul please don't let them see
Well let them see
It's an engagement not a crime
Sung
Christine what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue

You will understand in time

Grinning yellow
Spinning red
Masquerade!
Take your fill

Voices fade and turn to gasp a the light dim and the Phantom appears at the top of the stairway 
Why so silent good Messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me good Messieurs?
I have written you an opera
Here I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant!
Fondest greeting to you all
A few instruction just before rehearsal start
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my manager must learn that their place is in an office
Not the art
As for our star Miss Christine Daae
No doubt she'll do her best
It's true her voice is good
She know though
Should she wish to excel
She ha much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me her teacher
Her teacher
Your chain are still mine
spoken
You belong to me!
Think of me think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
And you'll find that once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said our love wa evergreen
Or a unchanging a the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me
Think of all the thing
We've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me trying too hard
To put you from my mind
Recall those day look back on all those time
Think of the thing we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine? Bravo!
Long ago it seemed so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her
Flowers fade the fruit of summer fade
They have their season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah
Night time sharpens heightens each sensation
Darkness stir and wake imagination
Silently the sens abandon their defence
Helpless to resist the note I write
For I compose the music of the night1
Slowly gently night unfurls it splendour
Grasp it sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thought away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world wa shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Down once more to the dungeon of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness deep a hell!
Why you ask
Was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
Track down this murderer
He must be found!
Hunt down this murderer
He must be found!
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind word from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why why...?
Your hand at the level of your eye
At the level of your eye
Your hand at the level of your eye At the level of your eye
Have you gorged yourself at last
In your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey
to your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me
To wallow in blood
Has also denied me
The joy of the flesh
This face this infection
Which poison our love
This face which earns
A mother's fear and loathing
A mask my first
Unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity come too late!
Turn around and face your fate!
An eternity of this
Before your eye
This haunted face
Holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul
That the true distortion lie
Wait!
I think my dear
We have a guest
Sir
Raoul!
This is indeed
An unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped
That you would come
And now my wish come true
You have truly made my night!
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?
Your lover make a passionate plea
Please Raoul
It's useless!
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
Show some compassion!
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine Christine
Let me see her!
Be my guest sir
Monsieur I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay
For the sin which are yours?
Order your fine horse now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now
Except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice
This is the point of no return!
The tear I might have shed
For your dark fate
Grow cold and turn to tear of hate!
Christine forgive me please forgive me
I did it all for you
And all for nothing
Farewell my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hope and now those hope are shattered!
Too late for turning back
Too late for prayer and useless pity
Say you love him
And my life is over
Past all hope of cry for help
No point in fighting
For either way you choose you cannot win
Either way you choose he ha to win!
So do you end your day with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Past the point of no return
Angel of Music
For pity's sake Christine say no!
Who deserves this?
The final threshold
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
Why do you curse mercy?
His life is now the prize
Which you must earn!
I fought so hard to free you
Angel of Music
You've passed the point of no return!
You deceived me!
I gave my mind blindly!
You try my patience
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you
You are not alone
Track down this murderer
He must be found!
Hunt out this animal who run to ground!
Take her forget me
Forget all of this
Leave me alone
Forget all you've seen
Go now don't let them find you
Take the boat
Swear to me never to tell
The secret you know of the angel in Hell
Go now! Go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper face on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Christine I love you...1
Say you'll share with me one love one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night each morning
You alone can make my song take flight
It's over now the music of the night!
Brava brava bravisima
Christine Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Really you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor?
Father wa spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now a I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he call me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He the unseen genius
Christine you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine you're talking in riddle
And it's not like you
Here in this room he call me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He the unseen genius
Christine you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine you're talking in riddle
And it's not like you
Your public need you!
We need you too!
Would you not rather have your
precious little ingenue?
Signora no
The world want you
Prima donna
first lady of the stage!
Your devotee
are on their knee
to implore you!
Can you bow out
when they're shouting
your name?
Think of how they all adore you
Prima donna
enchant u once again
Think of your muse
And of the queue
round the theatre!
Can you deny u the triumph in store?
Andre and Firmin-
Sing prima donna
once more!
Christine spoke of an angel
Prima donna
your song shall live again!
Think of your public!
You took a snub
but there's a public
who need you!
She ha heard the voice
of the angel of music
Those who hear your voice
liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry
of undying
support!
Is this her angel of music...?
We get our opera
She get her limelight!
Follow where the limelight
lead you!
Is this ghost
an angel or a madman...?
Angel or madman...?
Leading lady are a trial!
Prima donna
your song shall never die!
Voice of hell or of heaven...?
Heaven help you,|those who doubt
You'll sing again
and to unending
ovation!
Orders! Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
This miscasting
Will invite damnation
Tears oath
lunatic demand
are regular occurrences!
Bliss or damnation?
Which ha claimed her...?
Think how you'll shine
in that final
encore!
Sing prima donna
once more!
Oh fool
to have flouted his warnings!
Surely for her sake
Surely he'll strike back
Surely there'll be further scene -
worse than this!
Think before
these demand are rejected!
I must see these demand are rejected!
if his threat
and demand are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva
happy to relieve a
girl who's gone
and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette
entwined in love's duet!
Although he may demur
he must have been with her!
Christine must be protected!
O fortunata!
Non ancor
abbandonata!
You'd never get away
with all this in a play
but if it's loudly sung
and in a foreign tongue
it's just the sort of story
audience adore in fact a perfect
opera!
His game is over!
This is a game
you cannot hope to win!
And in Box Five
a new game will begin
For if his curse
is on this opera
But if his curse
is on this opera
Prima donna
the world is at your feet!
A nation wait
and how it hate
to be cheated!
The stress that fall upon a
famous prima donna!
Terrible deseases
cough and cold and sneezes!
Still the dryest throat
will reach the highest note
in search of perfect
opera!
then I fear the outcome
Christine play the Pageboy
Carlotta play the Countess
should you dare to
when you once again
Light up the stage
with that age-old rapport!
Sing prima donna
once more!
So it is war between us! If these demand are not met a disaster
beyond your imagination will occur!
Once more!
Past the point of no return no backward glance
Our game of make believe are at an end
Past all thought of if or when no use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks it door?
What sweet seduction lie before us?
Past the point of no return the final threshold
What warm unspoken secret will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return
You have brought me
To that moment when word run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence silence
I have come here hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our body entwining defenceless and silent
And now I am here with you
No second thought I've decided decided
Past the point of no return no going back now
Our passion play ha now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong one final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flame at last consume us?
Past the point of no return the final threshold
The bridge is crossed so stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return
Say you'll share with me one love one lifetime
Lead me save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you here beside you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of
What is it? What ha happened?
Ubaldo! Oh my God! My God!
We're ruined Andre ruined!
Monsieur le Vicomte!
Come with me!
Oh my darling my darling!
Who ha done this to you?
You! Why did you let this happen?
Monsieur le Vicomte
I know where they are
But can I trust you?
You must but remember
Your hand at the level of your eyes!
But why why?
The Punjab lasso Monsieur
First Buquet now Piangi
Like this Monsieur I'll come with you
No Meg! No you stay here!
Come with me Monsieur
Hurry or we shall be too late!
I remember
there wa mist   
swirling mist
upon a vast glassy lake   
There were candle
all around
and on the lake there
wa a boat
and in the boat
there wa a man   
Who wa that shape
in the shadows?
Whose is the face
in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying
Pandora!
You little demon -
is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little Iying
Delilah!
You little viper!
now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you   
Curse you   
Stranger
than you dreamt it -
can you even
dare to look
or bear to
think of me
this loathsome
gargoyle who

yearns for heaven
secretly   
secretly   
But Christine   
Fear can
Turn to love - you'll
learn to see to
find the man
behind the
this repulsive
carcass who
seems a beast but secretly

Oh Christine

Insolent boy this slave of passion
Basking in your glory Ignorant fool this brave young suitor Sharing in my triumph!
Angel I hear you Speak I listen Stay by my side Guide me Angel my soul wa weak forgive me Enter at last Master
Flattering child you shall know me See why in shadow I hide Look at your face in the mirror I am there inside
Christine turn her head to the mirror where the Phantom is beginning to appear
Angel of music guide and guardian grant to me your glory Angel of music hide no longer Come to me strange Angel
I am your Angel of Music Come to the angel of music
I am your Angel of Music Come to the Angel of Music
Monsieur Andre!

Quite a night I'm impressed
Well one doe one's best
Here's to u
A toast for the city!
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here!
Masquerade!  Paper face on parade Masquerade!  Hide your face so the world will never find you Masquerade!  Every face a different shade Masquerade!  Look around there's another mask behind you

What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud! All the crème De la crème
Mystery after gala night
It say mystery of soprano's flight
Mystified all the paper say
We are mystified we suspect foul play
Bad news on soprano's scene
First Carlotta now Christine
Still at least the seat get sold
Gossip's worth it weight in gold
Diva tender resignation
Cover doe a moonlight flit
Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheer
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre please don't shout!
It's publicity!
And the take is vast
Free publicity!
But we have no cast!
Andre have you seen the queue?
Ah it seems you've got one too
Dear Andre what a charming gala
Christine wa in a word sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note the diva's a disaster must you cast her when she's season past her prime!?!
Dear Firmin
Just a brief reminder
My salary ha not been paid
Send it care of the ghost by return of post
P.T.O
No one like a debtor so it's better if my order are obeyed!
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain
These are both signed O.G
Who the hell is he?
Opera Ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He is mocking our position!
In addition he want money!
What a funny apparition!
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae
Where is she?
Well how should we know?
I want an answer!
I take it that you sent me this note!
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark!
Monsieur dont argue!
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote? Written!
Do not fear for Miss Daae
The angel of music ha her under his wing
Make no attempt to see her again
If you didn't write it then who did?
Where is he?
Ah welcome back!
Your precious patron
Where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter
A letter which I rather resent
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me that this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
Your day at the Opera Populaire are numbered
Christine Daae
Christine Daae!
will be singing on your behalf tonight
Be prepared for a great misfortune
Should you attempt to take her place
Far too many note for my taste
And most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name--!
Miss Daae ha returned
I hope no worse for wear a far a we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best she wa alone
She needed rest
May I see her?
No Monsieur
She will see no one
Will she sing will she sing?
Here I have a note
Let me see it!
Please
Gentlemen
I have now sent you several note of the most amiable nature
Detailing how my theatre is to be run
You have not
followed my instruction
I shall give you one last chance
Christine Daae ha returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta a the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae play call for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent which make my casting in a word ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five
Which will be kept empty for me
Should these command be ignored
A disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain gentleman your obedient servant
O.G
Christine!
Whatever next?
It's all a plot to help Christine!
This is insane
I know who sent this
The Vicomte -- her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This change nothing!
O menititori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora
This man is mad!
We dont take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy -- the silent role
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori e vero?
Non non non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word beware to those...You have reviled me!
The angel see the angel know
You have rebuked me!
Signora pardon u
You have replaced me!
Please Signora
We beseech you
This hour shall see your darkest fear
I must see her
Abbandonata!
Deseredata!
O sventurata!
The angel see the angel hears
Where did she go...?
Abbandonata!
Disgraziata!
Signora sing for us!
Dont be a martyr
What new surprise lie in store...?
Our star!
Non vo' cantar!
Insolent boy this slave of fashion
Basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph!
Angel I hear you
Speak I listen
Stay by my side
Guide me
Angel my soul wa weak
Forgive me
Enter at last Master
Flattering child you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!
Angel of Music guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music hide no longer
Come to me strange Angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music
Christine! Christine!
Come to me Angel of Music!
I am your angel of music!
Why have you brought me here?
We can't go back there!
We must return!
He'll kill you!
His eye will find u there!
Christine don't say that
Those eye that burn!
Don't even think it
And if he ha to kill a thousand men
Forget this waking nightmare
The Phantom of the Opera will kill
This phantom is a fable
and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera
My God who is this man
My God who is this man
who hunt to kill?
this mask of death?
I can't escape from him
Whose is this voice you hear
I never will!
with every breath?
And in this labyrinth
where light is blind
the Phantom of the Opera
is here/there
inside your/my mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul I've been there to his world of
unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolve
into darkness darkness
Raoul I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted deformed it wa hardly a face
in the darkness darkness
But his voice filled my spirit
with a strange sweet sound
In that night there wa music in my mind
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard a I'd never heard before
What you heard wa a dream and nothing more
Yet in his eye all the sadness of the world
Those pleading eye that both threaten and adore
Christine Christine
Christine
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard a the outcast hears
Shamed into solitude
Shunned by the multitude
I learned to listen
In my dark my heart heard music
I longed to teach the world
Rise up and reach the world
No one would listen
I alone could hear the music
Then at last a voice in the gloom
Seemed to cry I hear you
I hear your fear
Your torment and your tear
She saw my loneliness
Shared in my emptiness
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard a the outcast hears
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard a the outcast hears
Here the sire may serve the dam here the master take his meat! here the sacrifical lamb utters one dispairing bleat
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweet
You will have to pay the bill- tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the master so that when table plan and maid are laid
Don Juan triumph once again!
Passarino faithful friend
Once again recite the plan
Your young guest belief I'm you
I the master you the man
When you met you wore my cloak
With my scarf you hid your face
She belief she dines with me
In her master's borrowed place!
Furtively we'll scoff and quaff
Stealing what in truth is mine
When it's late and modesty start to mellow with the wine!
You come home!
I use your voice
Slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say
Come hide with me!
Where oh where?
Of course my room
Poor thing hasn't got a chance
Here's my hat my cloak and sword
Conquest is assured
If I do not forget myself and laugh
No thought within her head but thought of joy
No dream within her heart but dream of love
Master?
Passarino go away for the trap is set
and wait for his prey!
You have come here
In pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now ha been silent
Silent
I have brought you
That our passion may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me dropped all defense
Completely succumbed to me Now you are here with me
No second thought
You've decided
Decided
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring u in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening
Go on
We shall play his game
Perform his work but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the door are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain fall
His reign will end!
Raoul I'm frightened
Don't make me do this
It scare me
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire
He'll take me I know
We'll be parted forever
He won't let me go
What I once used to dream I now dread
If he find me it won't ever end
[sung]And he'll always be there
singing song in my head
He'll always be there
singing song in my head
You said yourself
He wa nothing but a man
Yet while he life
He will haunt u 'til we're dead
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kill without a thought
He murder all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet I wish I could
Oh God if I agree
What horror wait for me
In this the Phantom's opera
Christine Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope and every prayer
rest on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
Wandering child
So lost so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father
Friend or phantom
Who is it there staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel oh speak
What endless longing
Echo in this whisper!
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beat against you
You resist
Phantom/Christine
Yet your/the soul obeys
Phantom/Christine
Angel of Music
You/I denied me/you!
Turning from true beauty!
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protecter!
Come to your/me strange Angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me Angel of Music
No Christine wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you may Draws sword believe
this man - this thing - is not your father!
No Raoul! No Not like this
Now let it be war upon you both
I gave you my music made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me denied me and betrayed me
He wa bound to love you when he heard you sing Christine
Say you'll share with me one love one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me each night each morning
You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you!
This trophy
From our savior
From our savior
From the enslaving force
Of Rome!
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration
We greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation
The trumpet of carthage resound
Hear Romans now and tremble
Hark to our step on ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return
To find the land we love
Threatened once more
By Roma's far-reaching grasp

Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness

Never dream that out in the world there are arm to hold you
You've always known Your heart wa on it's own
So laugh in your lonelyness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived life can be loved alone
