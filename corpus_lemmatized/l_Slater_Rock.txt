            When I Climb to the Top of Mount Rock       
            I wa strumming my axe
in my basement I
With my totally kick-ass band!
When an army of A&R men will arrive
with pen and contract in hand!
Then they’ll whisk me away
in a big black car
and the record accepts
and the girl will PR
And they’ll know from the start
what a major league star
I will be!
Just wait and see!
When I climb to the top of Mountain Rock!
And there staring down from the height
With the crowd at my foot
and a 7 inch bulge
in my lizard skin spandex tights
I’ll dive on an x rate into a crowd
When they’re screaming my name out loud
And the gate will unlock!!!!
At the top of mount rock
I’ll be blowin out amp
playing stadium show
I’m a sold out gonctic tour!
I will blister the ear
of the first thousand row
And leave while they beg for more!
And i’ll pop a champagne
And the party will rage
No brown M&Ms in my green room backstage
Bigger than Hendrix and Clapton and Page
And the rest!
The all time best!!!!
When I climb to the top of mount rock!
And perched at the uppermost peak
With a legion of groupie all dukin it out
For my chiseled wreck god physique
And i’ll spread hit single all over the land!
With all of my 12 Grammys in hand
Watch the fan-boys all flock!!!!
At the top of Mount Rock
All the doubter and the hater
and the hipster let ‘em laugh
Cause they’ll all be beggin for my Roadie’s autograph
I know my time is comin
And hopefully it’s comin
I’m pretty sure it’s comin any day!!!!
Once they hear me play!!!!!!!!
Then the dream that I had since the day I turned 10
Will be finally comin true
And no one’ll ever call me a loser again
Or tell me what I can’t do!
So I hold my head high and keep strumming those string
And grab any chance that my destiny brings
And i’ll rise and i’ll rise and i’ll rise
And the wing of my soul!!!!!
Up where I belong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And i’ll climb to the top of Mountain Rock!
And be part of that heavenly scene
With Odin and Zeus on Bass and the drum
And Thor playing tambourine
When Amus and Jambus and Judas appear!
And Jesus e’ll toss me a beer
And we’ll jam ‘round the clock!!!!
At the top of Mount Rock!
At the top of Mount Rock!
At the top of Mount Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            If Only You Would Listen       
            You always talk talk talk all the time
You never let me get in a word
I wish i had i had a dime
For ev’ry thought i’ve swallowed unheard
No matter what it is that i do
It’s like i just can’t seem to get through

I’ve got so much to say
If only you would listen
I’ve tried ev’ry which way
And still you never listen
Can’t you see i’m hurting?
I couldn’t be more clear
But i promise
One day i’ll make you hear

You know i try try try to explain--
I’m not the kid you want me to be
And yet it’s all it’s all in vain--
You just don’t wanna see the real me
You think you know what i’m all about--
And yet you just keep shutting me out!

I’ve got so much to share
If only you would listen
You could prove that you care
If only you would listen
I’m not gonna beg you--
You’ll never see a tear
But i promise one day i’ll make you hear

Yeah you’ll see one day
I’m gonna make you hear me
Gotta find a way
But you are gonna hear me
Got so much to say
And i’m gonna make you hear me

Maybe then you’ll listen!
You gotta listen!
You need to listen!
You better listen!

I’ve got so much inside
If only you would listen!
Joy and anger and pride
If only you would listen!
It’s not much i’m asking
I only want your ear
Yeah i promise one day i’ll make you hear
It’s not much i’m asking
I only want your ear

And i promise one day i’ll shake you
So damn hard that at last i’ll wake you
Yeah i promise one day i’ll make you hear!

            In the End of Time A Cappella Version       
            *It start off...a dark stage and then a beam of light and you can see me and my guitar*

In the end of time
There wa a man who knew the road
And the writing wa written on the stone

*And then a thin layer of fog come in around my ankle
Roadies that mean dry ice we're gonna talk about this later*

In the ancient time
An artist led the way
But no one seemed to understand

*Chimes Freddy*

In his heart he knew
The artist must be true
But the legend of the rent wa way past due

*And then Katie you come in with the bass*

Well you think you'll be just fine...without me but your mine!
You think you can kick me out of the band

*And then Zach you come in with the face melter*

Well there's just one problem there
The band is mine
How can you kick me out...of what is mine

*And then...Hawaii 5-0 you ever see that show? O.K well there's a drum solo in there
Shigadugadugdugadugaduga*

You?re not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore

*And then that's where I want the back-up singer to be like*

Well you?re not hardcore
No you?re not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
But the legend of the rent wa way hardcore

*Boom! Big ol' explosion...some like confetti come down
Anyway that's all I got so far it's a work in progress*

            Where Did the Rock Go?       
            Back when I wa younger wild and bold and free
I can still remember how the music used to be
Chords like rolling thunder loud beyond control
Every note and lyric branded right across my soul

Where did the rock go?
Where's the rush of those electric guitars?
Where are all those voice raised in heaven
Blazing down like shooting stars?

Tell me where is the passion?
Where's the rattle and the roar and the buzz?
Where do last year's one-hit-wonders go to?
And what happened to the girl I was?

Somehow I got older year by busy year
Guess the song kept playing but I didn't stop to hear
All that youth and swagger turned to grown-up doubt
a the world spun like a record and the music faded out

Where did the rock go?
Where's the pounding of the drum in my veins?
When did all the static fill the airwaves?
When it's gone then what remains?

Tell me where did the time go?
Where's the joy I used to know way back when?
Where's the power and the beauty?
Then the frantic end the rapture?
Where's the magic of the moment only rock could ever capture?
Now the only thing I'm hearing are the echo disappearing

Sorry for the outburst Please I'll be okay
Let's keep this our secret Who'd believe it anyway?
We'll pretend it never happened file it and forget
Still thanks for the reminder that there's music in the end

Where did the rock go?
All those feeling that I learned to ignore?
If you flip the record and start over doe it sound the way it did before?
Where did the rock go?

            School Of Rock Teacher&#039;s Pet       
            Baby we wa makin' straight A's
But we were stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lie
I feel like I've been hypnotized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-Wee! He come n spun my head around
He said Recess is in session
Two and two make five
And now baby oh I'm alive
Ah Yea! I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well baby you just better forget it
Rock got no reason rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time

Oh you know I wa on the Honor Roll
Got good grade and got no soul
Raise my hand before I can speak my mind
I've been biting my tongue too many time

And then that magic man took to obey uh huh
Do what magic man do not what magic man say
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's ass-ignment hem hem

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well baby you just better forget it
Rock got no reason rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well baby you just better forget it
Rock got no reason rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time

This is my final exam
Now ya'll know who I am
I might not be that perfect son
But ya'll be rockin' when I'm done
