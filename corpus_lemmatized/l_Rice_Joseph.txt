Some folk dream
of the wonder they'll do
Before their time on
this planet is through
Some just don't
have anything planned
They hide their hope
and their head in the sand
Now I don't say
who is wrong who is right
But if by chance you
are here for the night
Then all I need is an hour or two
To tell the tale of the dreamer like you
We all dream a lot
some are lucky some are not
But if you think it want it dream it
then it real you are what you feel
But all that I say
can be told another way
In the story of a boy who's dream came true
And it could be you
I closed my eye
drew back the curtain
to see for certain
what I thought I knew
Far far away
someone wa weeping
but the world wa sleeping
Any dream will do
I wore my coat
I wore my coat
with golden lining bright color shining
wonderful and new
And in the east
and in the east
the dawn wa breaking
and the world wa waking
Any dream will do
A crash of drum a flash of light
my golden coat flew out of sight
The color faded into darkness
I wa left alone
May I return
to the beginning?
the light is dimming
and the dream is too
The world and I
the world and I
We are still waiting
still hesitating any dream will do
Any dream any dream will
Any dream
Any dream will do
Any dream will do
Way way back many century ago
not long after the Bible began
Jacob lived in the land of Canaan
a fine example of a family man
Jacob Jacob and son
depended on farming to earn their keep
Jacob Jacob and son
spent all of their day in the field with sheep
Jacob wa the founder of a whole new nation
Thanks to the number of child he'd had
He wa also known a Israel but most of the time
His son and his wife used to call him dad
Jacob Jacob and son
men of the soil of the sheaf and crook
Jacob Jacob and son
a remarkable family in anyone's book
Reuben wa the eldest of the child of Israel
With Simeon and Levi the next in line
Napthali and Isaachar with Asher and Dan
Zebulun and Gad took the total to nine
Jacob Jacob and son
Benjamin and Judah which leaf only one
Jacob Jacob and son
Joseph Jacob's favorite son
Jacob Jacob and son
Jacob Jacob and son
Jacob Jacob and son
Jacob Jacob Jacob -- Jacob and son
Joseph's mother she wa quite my favorite wife
I never really loved another all my life
And Joseph wa my joy because
He reminded me of her
Through young Joseph Jacob lived his youth again
Loved him praised him gave him all he could
but then it made the rest feel second best
And even if they were
Being told were also-ran
Does not make u Joseph fan
But where they have really missed the boat is
We're great guy but no-one seems to notice
Joseph's charm and winning smile
Fail to slay them in the aisle
And their father couldn't see the danger
He could not imagine any danger
He just saw in Joseph all his dream come true
Jacob wanted to show the world he loved his son
To make it clear that Joseph wa the special one
So Jacob bought his son a coat
A multi-colored coat to wear
Joseph's coat wa elegant the cut wa fine
The tasteful style wa the ultimate in good design
And this is why it caught the eye
A king would stop and stare
And when Joseph tried it on
He knew his sheepskin day were gone
Such a dazzling coat of many color
How he loved his coat of many color
In a class above the rest
It even went well with his vest
Such a stunning coat of many color
How he loved his coat of many color
It wa red and yellow and green and brown and blue
Joseph's brother weren't too pleased
with what they saw
We had never liked him all that much before
And now this coat Has got our goat
We feel life is unfair
And when Joseph graced the scene
His brother turned a shade of green
His astounding clothing took the biscuit
Quite the smoothest person in the district
I look handsome I look smart
I am a walking work of art
Such a dazzling coat of many color
How I love my coat of many color
It wa red and yellow and green and brown
And scarlet and black and ocher and peach
And ruby and olive and violet and fawn
I look handsome I look smart
And lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve
I am a walking work of art
And cream and crimson and silver and rose 
Such a dazzling coat of many color
And azure and lemon and russet and grey
How I love my coat of many color
And purple and white and pink and orange
It wa red and yellow and green and brown
And scarlet and black and ocher and peach
And ruby and olive and violet and fawn
And lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve
And cream and crimson and silver and rose
And azure and lemon and russet and grey
And purple and white and pink and orange
And blue!!!
Joseph's coat annoyed his brother
But what make u mad
Are the thing that Joseph tell u
of the dream he's often had
I dreamed that in the field one day
the corn gave my a sign
Your eleven sheaf of corn
all turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf wa quite a sight to see
a golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
and really rather small
This is not the kind of thing
we brother like to hear
It seems to u that Joseph and his dream
should disappear
I dreamed I saw eleven star
the sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star
it made me wonder why
Could it be that I wa born
for higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government
a ministry or two?
The dream of our dear brother
are the decade's biggest yawn
His talk of star and golden sheaf
is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but he's also rather dim
For there's eleven of u and
there's only one of him
The dream of course will not come true
That is we think they won't come true
That is we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?
What if he's right all along?
The dream are more than crystal clear
the writing on the wall
Means that Joseph some day
soon will rise above u all
The accuracy of the dream
we brother do not know
But one thing we are sure about
the dreamer
the dreamer
the dreamer ha to go!
Next day far from home
the brother planned the repulsive crime
Let u grab him now do him in
while we've got the time
Hi guys!
This they did and made the most of it
Tore his coat and flung him in a pit
Let u leave him here all alone
and he's bound to die
When some Ishmaelites a hairy crew
came riding by
In a flash the brother changed their plan
We need cash! Let's sell him if we can
Poor poor Joseph what'cha gonna do?
Things look bad for you hey
what'cha gonna do?
Poor poor Joseph what'cha gonna do?
Things look bad for you hey
what'cha gonna do?
Could you use a slave you hairy
bunch of Ishmaelites?
Young strong well-behaved going cheap
and he read and writes
In a trice the dirty deal wa done
Silver coin for Jacob's favorite son
Then the Ishmaelites galloped
off with a slave in tow
Off to Egypt where Joseph
wa not too keen to go
It wouldn't be a picnic he could tell
And I don't speak Egyptian very well
Joseph's brother tore his precious
multi-colored coat
Having ripped it up next they
attacked a passing goat
Soon the wretched creature wa no more
They dipped his coat in blood and gut and gore
Oh now brother how low can you stoop?
You make a sordid group hey
how low can you stoop?
Poor poor Joseph sold to be a slave
Situation's grave hey sold to be a slave
Father we've something to tell you
a story of our time
a tragic but inspiring tale of manhood in it prime
You know you had a dozen son
well now that's not quite true
But feel no sorrow do not grieve
he would not want you to
you see there's one more angel in Heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph we'll never forget you
It's tough but we're gonna get by
There's one le place at our table
There's one more tear in my eye
But Joseph the thing that you stood for
Like love and peace never die
When I think of his last great battle
A lump come to my throat
It take a man who know not fear
To wrestle with a goat
his blood stained coat is tribute to
his final sacrifice
his body may be past it's peak
but his soul in paradise
So long little Joe
Adios Buckaroo
10-4 good buddy
There's one last place at our table
There's one more tear in my eye
But Joseph the thing that you stood for
Like truth and light never die
Carve his name with pride and courage
Let no tear be shed
if he had not laid down his life
we all would now be dead
There's one more angel in Heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph the thing that you stood for
Like truth and light never die
There's one more angel in Heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph the thing that you stood for
Like truth and light never die
There's one more angel in Heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph the thing that you stood for
Like truth and light never 
There's one more angel in Heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Father that thing he stood for
Like democracy never 
die!
Joseph wa taken to Egypt in chain and sold
Where he wa bought by a captain named Potipher
Potiphar had very few care
He wa one of Egypt's millionaire
Having made a fortune
buying share in
pyramid
Potiphar had made a huge pile
Owned a large percentage of the Nile
Meant that I could really live in style
and he did
Oh I did
Joseph wa an unimportant slave
who found he liked his master
Consequently worked much harder
even with devotion
Potiphar could see that Joseph
wa a cut above the average
Made him leader of the house
a maximum promotion
Potiphar wa cool and so fine
But his wife would never toe the line
It's all there in chapter thirty-nine Of Genesis
She wa beautiful but evil
Saw a lot of men against his will
He would have to tell her
that she still wa his
Your mine!
Joseph's look and handsome figure
had attracted her attention
Every morning she would beckon
Come and lie with me love
Joesph wanted to resist her
till one day she proved too eager
Joseph cried in vain
Please stop! I don't believe in free love!
pity
Potiphar wa counting shekel
in his den below the bedroom
When he heard a mighty rumpus
clattering above him
Suddenly he knew his rich couldn't
buy him what he wanted
Gold would never make him happy
if she didn't love him
Letting out a mighty roar
Potiphar burst through the door
Joseph I'll see you rot in jail!
The thing you have done are beyond the pale!
Poor poor Joseph locked up in a cell
Things ain't going well hey locked up in a cell
Poor poor Joseph locked up in a cell
Things ain't going well hey locked up in a cell
locked up in a cell
Close every door to me
hide all the world from me
Bar all the window and shut out the light
Do what you want with me
hate me and laugh at me
Darken my daytime and torture my night
If my life were important
I would ask will I live or die
But I know the answer lie far from this world
Close every door to me
keep those I love from me
Children of Israel are never alone
For I know I shall find my
own peace of mind
For I have been promised
a land of my own
Close every door to me
hide all the world from me
Bar all the window and shut out the light
Just give me a number instead of my name
Forget all about me and let me decay
I do not matter I'm only one person
Destroy me completely then throw me away
If my life were important
I would ask will I live or die
But I know the answer lie far from this world
Close every door to me
keep those I love from me
Children of Israel are never alone
For we know we shall find our
own peace of mind
For we have been promised a land of our own
Joseph's luck wa really out
his spirit and his fortune low
Alone he sat
alone he thought of happy
time he used to know
Hey dreamer! Don't be so upset
Hey Joseph! You're not beaten yet
Go Go Go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
Don't give up Joseph fight till you drop
We've read the book and
you come out on top
The prison wall were wet and black
his chain were heavy weighed him down
the candle wa his only light
the hungry rat the only sound
Hey dreamer! Don't be so upset
Hey Joseph! You're not beaten yet
Go Go Go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
don't just up Joseph
wait and you'll see
we've been outside and your on the marquee
Now into Joseph's prison cell were
flung two very frightened men
We don't think that we will ever
see the light of day again
Hey Joseph! Help u if you can
We've had dream that we don't understand
Both men were servant of Pharaoh the king
Both in the doghouse for doing their thing
One wa a baker a cook in his prime
One wa a butler the Jeeves of his time
Tell me of your dream my friend
and I will tell you what they show
Though I cannot guarantee to get it right
I'll have a go
First the butler trembling took the floor
Nervously he spoke of what he saw
There I wa standing in front of a vine
I picked some grape and I
crushed them to wine
I gave them to Pharaoh who
drank from my cup
I tried to interpret but I had to give up
You will soon be free my friend
so do not worry any more
The king will let you out of here
you'll buttle a you did before
Next the baker rose to tell his dream
Hoping it would have a similar theme
There I wa standing with basket of bread
High in the sky I saw bird overhead
Who flew to the basket
and ate every slice
Give me the message -
- like his would be nice
Sad to say your dream is not the
kind of dream I'd like to get
Pharaoh ha it in for you
your execution date is set
Don't rely on all I say I saw
It's just that I have not
been wrong before
Go go go Joe
Go go go Joe
Go go go Joe
Go go go Joe
Go Go Go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
Sha la la Joseph you're still in your prime
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Go Go Go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
Sha la la Joseph you're still in your prime
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Go Go Go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
Sha la la Joseph you're still in your prime
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Go Go Go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
Sha la la Joseph you're still in your prime
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Ahead of your time
Ahead of my time
Ahead of your time
Ahead of my time
Ahead of your time
Ahead of my time
Ahead of your time
Ahead of my time
Ahead of your time
Ahead of my time
Ahead of your time
Ahead of your
Time!!!
Pharaoh he wa a powerful man
With the ancient world in the palm of his hand
To all intent and purpose he
Was Egypt with a capital E
Whatever he did
He wa showered with praise
If he cracked a joke
Then you chortled for day
No one had right or a
Vote but the king
In fact you might say
He wa fairly right-wing
When Pharaoh's around
Then you get down on the ground
If you ever find yourself near Ramses
Get down on your knee
A Pharaoh's story
Down at the other
End of the scale
Joseph is still
Doing time in jail
For even though he is
in with the guard
A lifetime in prison seems
quite on the card
But if my analysis of
The position is right
At the end of the tunnel
There's a glimmer of light
For all of a sudden
Indescribable thing
Have shattered the sleep of
both peasant and king
Strange a it seems there's
been a run of crazy dream
And a man who can interpret could go far
could become a star
Could be famous could
be a big success
Could be famous could
be a big success
Strange a it seems there's
been a run of crazy dream
And a man who can
interpret could go far
could become a star
Could be famous could
be a big success
Could be famous could
be a big success
there's been a run of crazy dream
And a man who can
interpret could go far
could become a star
Could be a star!
Guess what? In his bed Pharaoh
had an uneasy night
He had had a dream that pinned
him to his sheet with fright
No one knew the meaning of the dream
What to do?
Whatever could it mean?
Then his butler said
I know of a bloke in jail
Who is hot on dream
could explain old Pharaoh's tale
Pharaoh said
Well fetch this Joseph man
I need him to help
me if he can
Poor poor Pharaoh
what'cha gonna do?
Dreams are haunting you

Chained and bound afraid alone
Joseph stood before the throne
My service to Pharaoh ha begun
Tell me your problem

PHARAOH IS IN THE BUILDING!

Seven year of bumper
crop are on their way
Years of plenty endless
wheat and ton of hay
Your farm will boom
there won't be room
To store the surplus
food you grow
After that the future
doesn't look so bright
Egypt's luck will change
completely overnight
And famine's hand
will stalk the land
With food an all time low Noble king
there is no doubt
What your dream are all about
All these thing you
saw in your pajama
Are a long range
forecast for your farmer
And I'm sure it's
crossed your mind
What it is you have to find
Find a man to lead
you through the famine
With a flair for
economic planning
But who this man could
be I just don't know
who this man could
be I just don't know
who this man could
be I just don't know
who this man could
be I just don't know
who this man could
be I just don't know
Joe!
Pharaoh said
Well stone the crow
this Joseph is a clever kid
Who'd have thought
that fourteen cow
could mean the thing
he said they did?
Joseph you must
help me further
I have found a job for you
You shall lead u
through this crisis
You shall be
my number two
Pharaoh told his guard to fetch
a chisel from the local store
Whereupon he ordered them
to cut the chain that Joseph wore
Joseph got a royal pardon and
a host of splendid thing
A chariot of gold a cloak
a medal and some signet ring
Joseph!
Pharaoh's number two
Joseph!
Egypt look to you
Joseph!
Pharaoh's number two
Joseph! Egypt look to you
Jo--seph!
Seven summer on the trot were
perfect just a Joseph said
Joseph saw that food wa gathered
ready for the year ahead
Seven year of famine followed
Egypt did not mind a bit The first
recorded rationing in history wa a hit
Joseph how can we ever say
All that we want to about you?
We're so glad that you came our way
We should have perished without you
Hey! Joseph we are the perfect team
Old buddy now that's you and me
I wa wise to have chosen you
You'll be wise to agree
Joseph how can we ever say
All that we want to about you?
We're so glad that you
came our way
We should have perished without you
Hey! We were in a jam
Would have baffled Abraham
But now we're a partnership
it's just a piece of cake
Greatest man since Noah
Only go to show-ah
Anyone from anywhere can
make it if they get a lucky break!
This could be the happy ending
perfect place to stop the show
Joseph after all ha got about
a far a he can go
But I'm sure that Jacob
and his other son
have crossed your mind
How had famine hit the
family Joseph left behind?
Do you remember the
good year in Canaan?
The summer were endlessly gold
The field were a patchwork of clover
The winter were never too cold
We'd stroll down the
boulevard together
And everything wa simply divine
Now the field are dead and bare
No joie de vivre anywhere
Et maintenant we drink a bitter wine
Those Canaan day we used to know
Where have they gone?
Where did they go?
Eh bien raise your beret
To those Canaan day
Do you remember those
wonderful parties?
The splendor of Canaan's cuisine
Those extravagant elegant soiree
The gayest the Bible ha seen
It's funny but since we lost Joseph
We've gone to the other extreme
No one come to dinner now
We'd only eat them anyhow
I even find I'm missing
Joseph's dream
Those Canaan day
we used to know
Where have they gone?
Where did they go?
Eh bien raise your beret
To those Canaan day
Those Canaan day
we used to know
Where have they gone?
Where did they go?
Eh bien raise your beret
To those Canaan day
It's funny
but since we lost Joseph
We've gone to the other extreme
Perhaps we all misjudged the lad
Perhaps he wasn't quite that bad
And how we miss
his entertaining dream
Those Canaan day
we used to know
Where have they gone?
Where did
did they go?
Eh bien raise your beret
To those Canaan day
Eh bien raise your beret
To those Canaan day
So back in Canaan the
future looked rough
Jacob's family were finding it tough
For the famine ha
caught u unprepared
We are thin we are ill
we are getting scared
It's enough to make anyone weep
We are down to
our very last sheep
We will starve if
we hang around here
But in Egypt there's
food going spare
They've got corn
they've got meat
they've got fruit and drink
And if we have the time
we could see the Sphinx
So they finally decided to go
Off to Egypt to see brother Joe
So they all lay before Joseph's foot
Mighty prince
give u something to eat!
Joseph found it a
strain not to laugh because
Not brother among them
knew who he wa
I shall now take
them all for a ride
After all they have
tried fratricide
I dreamed that in the field one
day at corn give me a sign
Your eleven sheaf of corn
all turned and bowed to mine
I dreamed I saw eleven star
the sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star
and now I realize why
How do I know
where you come from?
You could be spy
telling me that you are hungry
That could be lie
How do I know
who you are?
Why do you think
I should help you?
Would you help me?
Why on earth should
I believe you?
I've no guarantee
Grovel grovel cringe
bow stoop fall
Worship worship beg
kneel sponge crawl
Grovel grovel cringe
bow stoop fall
Worship worship beg
kneel sponge crawl
We are just eleven brother
good men and true
Though we know we
count for nothing
when up next to you
Honesty's our middle name
Life is slowly ebbing from u
hope's almost gone
It's getting very hard to see
u from sideways on
Grovel grovel cringe
bow stoop fall
Worship worship beg
kneel sponge crawl
I rather like the
way you're talking
astute and sincere
Suddenly your tragic story
get me right here
This is what we
hoped you'd say!
All this tugging at
my heartstrings
seems quite justified
I shall give you what
you came for
a lot more beside
Joseph handed them
sackloads of food
And they groveled
with base gratitude
Then unseen Joseph
nipped out around the back
And planted a cup in
young Benjamin's sack
When the brother
were ready to go
Joseph turned to them all
with a terrible stare and said
No!
Stop! You robber
your little number's up!
One of you ha stolen my
precious golden cup!
Joseph started searching
through his brothers' sack
Everyone wa nervous
no one could relax
Who's the thief?
Is it Reuben?
No!
Is it Simeon?
No!
Is it Napthali?
No!
Is it Dan?
No!
Is it Asher?
No!
Is it Isaachar?
No!
Is it Levi?
No!
Who's the man?
Is it Zebulun?
No!
Is it Gad?
No!
Is it Judah?
No!
Is it him?
could it be?
could it possibly be
Benjamin?
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Benjamin you nasty youth
your crime ha shocked
me to the core!
Never in my whole career have
I encountered this before!
Guards seize him!
Lock him in a cell!
Throw the key into
the Nile a well!
Each of the brother
fell to his knee
Show him some mercy
oh mighty one please!
He would not do this
he must have been framed!
Jail u and beat u
we should be blamed
Oh no not he
How you can accuse
him is a mystery
Save him
take me
Benjamin is straighter
than the tall palm tree
I hear the steel drum
sing their song
They singing man you know
you got it wrong
I hear the voice of the yellow bird
Singing in the tree
this is quite absurd
Oh yes it's true
Benjamin is straighter
than the big bamboo
No ifs no buts
Benjamin is honest
a coconut
Sure a the tide
wash the golden sand
Benjamin is an
innocent man
Sure a banana
need the sun
We are the
criminal guilty one
Oh no not he
How you can
accuse him is a mystery
Save him take me
Benjamin is straighter
than the tall palm tree
Oh no not he
How you can accuse
him is a mystery
Save him take me
Benjamin is straighter
than the tall palm tree
Sure a the tide wash the
golden sand
Benjamin is an innocent man
Sure a banana
need the sun
We are the
criminal guilty one
Oh no not he
How you can accuse
him is a mystery
Save him take me
Benjamin is straighter
than the tall palm tree
Oh no not he
How you can accuse
him is a mystery
Save him take me
Benjamin is straighter
than the tall palm tree
Each of the brother
fell to his knee
Show him some mercy
oh mighty one please!
He would not do this
he must have been framed!
Jail u and beat u
we should be blamed
And Joseph knew by this
his brother now were
honest men
The time had
come at last
to reunite
them all again
Can't you recognize
my face?
Is it hard to see?
That Joseph
who you thought wa dead
your brother is me
Joseph! Joseph!
Is it really true?
Joseph! Joseph!
Is it really you?
Joseph! Joseph!
So Jacob came to Egypt
no longer feeling old
And Joseph went to meet him
in his chariot of gold
of gold!
of gold!
of gold!
I closed my eye
drew back the curtain
to see for certain
what I thought I knew
Far far away
someone wa weeping
But the world wa sleeping
Any dream will do
I wore my coat
with golden lining
Bright color shining
wonderful and new
And in the east
the dawn wa breaking
And the world wa waking
Any dream will do
A crash of drum
a flash of light
My golden coat
flew out of sight
The color faded
into darkness
I wa left alone
May I return
to the beginning
The light is dimming
and the dream is too
The world and I
we are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
May I return
to the beginning
The light is dimming
and the dream is too
The world and I
we are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
Give me my colored coat
my amazing colored coat!
Give me my colored coat
my amazing colored coat!
